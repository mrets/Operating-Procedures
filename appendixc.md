# Appendix C: Transfer Appendix

**Export Transfer**

M-RETS will work with Compatible Tracking Systems (CTSs) to ensure a credible and reliable method for exporting RECs to a CTS. Currently approved CTSs for exporting are:

- Michigan Renewable Energy Certification System (MIRECS)
- North American Renewables Registry (NAR)
- North Carolina Renewable Energy Tracking System (NC-RETS)

The processes for export and import transfers are identical. Please see the import transfer process below for more information on how to complete a transfer with a CTS.

- Michigan Renewable Energy Certification System (MIRECS)
- North American Renewables Registry (NAR)
- North Carolina Renewable Energy Tracking System (NC-RETS)
- Texas Renewable Energy Trading Program (ERCOT)

_ **The following Import Process defines how Certificates are imported to M-RETS from** _ **Compatible Tracking Systems (CTS)**

_ **Process** _

1. _1.__CTS Organization selects a batch of Certificates and initiates an export transfer in a CTS. As part of the export process the CTS Organization is asked to select from a drop-down menu which registry the Certificates should be transferred to what Organization._
2. _2.__M-RETS will receive a notification that an import has been initiated. The CTS Administrator will provide an Import File to M-RETS with all applicable data as required by M-RETS._
3. _3.__ M-RETS_ confirms that the Generating Unit has previously been approved as an Import Generator in M-RETS. If yes, transaction will proceed. If no, M-RETS will complete the Import Generator Certification with the applicable Eligibility Flags verified using the information provided in the Import File.
4. _4.__If M-RETS cannot validate the Import Generator meets the eligibility criteria for M-RETS, M-RETS_ informs the _CTS_ Administrator of the unsuccessful transfer by email.
5. _5.__If the transfer is approved, M-RETS will allow the applicable Certificates to be issued and delivered to the designated M-RETS Organization. The import serial number uses the standard M-RETS format with the CTS name inserted into the format, for example:_

_MIRECS-123-MI-01-2009-123-1 to 1_
