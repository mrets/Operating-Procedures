Section 4.5: Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)
-------------------------------------------------

### Section 4.5.1: Creation of Certificates

Small Generators (1 to 150 kW) have up to one year from the generation
end date to upload generation. Large Generators (\>150 kW) have 62 days
from the generation end date to upload generation. This applies
regardless of whether the Generator is self-reporting or uses a QRE.
M-RETS must approve any generation outside of these ranges.

All generation data submitted to M-RETS will undergo an automatic
validation process. The process includes an automated verification
process that reviews the feasibility of the generation amount, ensures
there are no overlapping generation entries, and that there are no
lapses in generation information.

M-RETS only issues Certificates in whole numbers. A Certificate created
and tracked within M-RETS represents all renewable attributes from one
MWh of renewable generation. M-RETS Certificates are "Whole
Certificates," meaning that none of the renewable attributes may be
split off from the Certificate while it is in circulation in M-RETS.

Depending on User settings, the System will notify the User via email
that generation has been posted. The generation posting will be marked
"Issued" on the Generation Log.

Certificates in M-RETS do not have a specific expiration date. States
and Provinces define the lifetime or expiration date for Certificates as
applied to the programs they oversee.

M-RETS will issue one electronic Certificate for each MWh of energy
generated by those Generating Units registered with M-RETS. Certificates
will be issued based on the number of whole MWhs on the Generation Log
on the day of Certificate creation. M-RETS will issue Certificates no
more frequently than once per month per Generating Unit.

### Section 4.5.2: Data Fields Carried on Each Certificate

a.  Serial Number(s)

b.  Account

c.  ID

d.  Generator Fuel Type

e.  Vintage Date

f.  Location

g.  Quantity

h.  Eligibilities

### Section 4.5.3: Retirement of Certificates

Certificate Retirement is an action taken by the User to remove a
Certificate from circulation. M-RETS is not responsible for ensuring
that Users Retire Certificates for voluntary or compliance purposes.
M-RETS requires all Users to initiate and complete all retirements.
M-RETS maintains an integrated online help guide that Users can access
[here](https://help.mrets.org/en/).

M-RETS has a pull-down menu of options for acceptable retirement reasons
that the Organization must select to complete the retirement. The
options will be consistent with regulatory programs and any voluntary
programs or voluntary market activities. Users shall notify M-RETS if
they would like to add a new type of voluntary or compliance retirement
reason.

### Section 4.5.4: Retirement Types

#### Beneficial Ownership (BBO)

-   Formal Definition: With respect to any Credit, Beneficial Ownership
    > Rights means any contractual or other right to direct or control
    > the sale or other disposition of, or the Retirement of, such
    > Credit or (ii) any contractual or other right to receive the
    > benefits of such Credit or any proceeds from the sale or other
    > disposition of such Credit.

-   M-RETS Uses: All retirements for the benefit of an individual owner
    > for a general environmental reason (i.e. company purchasing RECs
    > to green their operation). Within this Retirement type there are
    > additional options in the "Reason" drop down box. One of the
    > reasons is utility retirement on behalf of all customers. This
    > Reason should be selected when a utility is looking to make a
    > voluntary retirement that can be applied to all customers. An
    > example of this is the Green Advantage® program through
    > [MidAmerican Energy
    > Company](https://www.midamericanenergy.com/green-advantage) or the
    > [Certified Renewable
    > Percentage](https://www.xcelenergy.com/energy_portfolio/renewable_energy/certified_renewable_percentage)
    > offered through Xcel Energy.

> An Additional Details field is provided to allow the User to provide
> specific information about the sale (i.e. customer name, retirement
> year) Note: Compliance or Green-e Voluntary programs should not use
> the Beneficial Ownership retirement type. All RPS retirements
> (Including IL ARES Retirements) should use the State-Regulated Utility
> Renewable Portfolio Standard/Provincial Utility Portfolio Standard
> (RPS) Retirement Type. Green-e Voluntary Retirements should use the
> Green-e Energy Certified Voluntary Market Sale Retirement Type. 

#### Green-e Energy Certified Voluntary Market Sale (GRN)

-   M-RETS Uses: All Green-e Retirements. To retire Certificates to
    > substantiate sales made in a given calendar year as "Green-e
