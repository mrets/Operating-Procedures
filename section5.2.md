## Section 5.2: WI Non-Bankable

M-RETS classifies Certificates that are not WI RRC eligible and less than one year old as WI Non-Bankable. Organizations may only retire Certificates for the Wisconsin RPS that are Non-Bankable for the compliance year matching the vintage listed on the Certificate. For example, a Wisconsin compliance Organization may retire a 2017 WI Non-Bankable Certificate for the 2017 Wisconsin RPS but not for the 2018 Wisconsin RPS. Because M-RETS does not set expiration dates on RECs, a User may still use a 2017 Wisconsin Non-Bankable REC for other purposes if that REC meets the guidelines for other state or voluntary programs. After the closure of the Wisconsin RPS program each year, M-RETS will remove the WI Non-Bankable designation from Certificates that are not in an M-RETS Retirement Account but no longer qualify according to Wisconsin state law and regulations.
