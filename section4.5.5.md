### Section 4.5.5: Retirement Types

#### Beneficial Ownership (BBO)

- Formal Definition: With respect to any Credit, Beneficial Ownership Rights means any contractual or other right to direct or control the sale or other disposition of, or the Retirement of, such Credit or (ii) any contractual or other right to receive the benefits of such Credit or any proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such Credit.
- M-RETS Uses: All retirements for the benefit of an individual owner for a general environmental reason (i.e. company purchasing RECs to green their operation). Within this Retirement type there are additional options in the &quot;Reason&quot; drop down box. One of the reasons is utility retirement on behalf of all customers. This Reason should be selected when a utility is looking to make a voluntary retirement that can be applied to all customers. An example of this is the Green AdvantageÂ® program through [MidAmerican Energy Company](https://www.midamericanenergy.com/green-advantage) or the [Certified Renewable Percentage](https://www.xcelenergy.com/energy_portfolio/renewable_energy/certified_renewable_percentage)offered through Xcel Energy.

An Additional Details field is provided to allow the User to provide specific information about the sale (i.e. customer name, retirement year) Note: Compliance or Green-e Voluntary programs should not use the Beneficial Ownership retirement type. All RPS retirements (Including IL ARES Retirements) should use the State-Regulated Utility Renewable Portfolio Standard/Provincial Utility Portfolio Standard (RPS) Retirement Type. Green-e Voluntary Retirements should use the Green-e Energy Certified Voluntary Market Sale Retirement Type.

#### Green-e Energy Certified Voluntary Market Sale (GRN)

- M-RETS Uses: All Green-e Retirements. To retire Certificates to substantiate sales made in a given calendar year as &quot;Green-e Energy certified&quot;, the party retiring Certificates must have a contract in place with Center for Resource Solutions to make Green-e Energy certified sales in that year of sale.

#### Utility Green Pricing (UGP)

- M-RETS Uses: Utility Green Pricing Program Retirements. Note: &quot;Green-e Energy Certified&quot; Utility Green Pricing Program Retirements should use the Green-e Energy Certified Voluntary Market Sale Retirement Reason.
