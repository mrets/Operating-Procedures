### Section 4.4.4: Measurement of Generation and Adjustments

M-RETS will measure the output from each Generating Unit delivered into either the transmission or distribution grid. Certificates do not reflect nor does M-RETS measure losses occurring on the bulk transmission or distribution systems after the metering. M-RETS will not create Certificates for that portion of the generation used to supply station service. Therefore, generation data supplied to M-RETS must not reflect station service supplied from the Generator&#39;s side of the point of interconnection. For wholesale Generators also serving on-site loads, M-RETS will create Certificates for the on-site load distinct from station service, if the Generator Owner can provide evidence that the metering used is capable of distinguishing between on-site load and station service. Otherwise, M-RETS will assume a conservative default fraction of total generation is station service unless it can be proved otherwise.

If, due to metering, reporting, error or any other reason, the data requires an adjustment, the reporting entity must report the adjustment as soon as possible to M-RETS.
