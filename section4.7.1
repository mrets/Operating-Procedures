### Section 4.7.1: Establishing a Program

Users can create a Program for internal use or can invite other M-RETS Organizations to participate.

Any User within a General Account Subscription Organization that has Program manage permissions can create an Internal Program. Only Organizations that create Internal Programs can use and view the Program. Any Account created as part of the Internal Program will be subject to the associated Program Ruleset.

Any User within a General Account Subscription Organization that has Program manage permissions or a Program Administrator can create an External Program. The Administrator of an External Program can invite an unlimited number of other M-RETS Organizations to participate in a Program. All participants will receive a notification inviting them to participate in the Program. Prior to becoming active Program participants, the invitee must accept the invitation.
