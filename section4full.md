Section 4: The Tracking System
Section 4.1: Users
Users may create additional Users within their Organization by accessing the Organization information tab within the System.

M-RETS expressly prohibits the sharing of User credentials. M-RETS requires every person that logs into the System to have their own separate User login credentials. M-RETS tracks the specific activities of each User through the unique User ID and password.

More information about confidentiality can be found in the M-RETS Terms of Use.

Section 4.1.1: User Permissions
Every User in M-RETS has customizable permissions. Users can be set as Manage, Read Only, or No Access. Only a User with Manage permissions for the Organization can change permissions. The abilities of each level are as follows:

Manage: Ability to view and edit the topic
Read Only: Ability to solely view the topic
No Access: Inability to view or edit the topic
Section 4.1.1.1: Organization Permission
In M-RETS, 'Organization' refers to the Organization Information, Billing Contact Information, and User List.

Section 4.1.1.2: Transactions Permission
In M-RETS, 'Transactions' refers to incoming and outgoing transfers of Certificates. A User with 'Manage' permissions will be able to transfer as well as accept incoming transfers of Certificates.

Section 4.1.1.3: Generators Permission
In M-RETS, 'Generators' refers to Projects and Generators. A User with 'Manage' permission will be able to create new Generators and edit current Generators.

Section 4.1.1.4: Billing Permission
In M-RETS, 'Billing' refers to the invoicing System. A User with 'Manage' permissions will be able to view and save invoice details.

Section 4.1.1.5: API Permission
In M-RETS, 'API' refers to the application programming interface. Any User that intends to connect and use our API will need Manage permissions.

Section 4.1.1.6: Generation Permission
In M-RETS, 'Generation' refers to the uploading and issuance of Certificates. A User with 'Manage' permissions will be able to upload MWh information for issuance.

Section 4.1.2: Notification Settings
M-RETS allows Users to opt into email notifications when certain changes occur to their Organization. By default, M-RETS disables email notifications. M-RETS encourages Users to enable email notifications in their settings. An informational walk-through on notification settings is on the integrated help system.

There are three notification settings:

Transfers
Issuances
Retirements
Section 4.1.3: Notification Categories

Section 4.1.3.1: Transfers
This setting automatically emails Users upon initiation and completion of a transfer.

Example:

Section 4.1.3.2: Issuance
This setting emails Users upon generation data upload.

Example:

Section 4.1.3.3: Retirements
This setting emails Users when Certificates are retired.

Example:

Section 4.1.4: Inactivating Users
It is the Organization's responsibility to make sure the User list is current. This includes inactivating Users when they leave the company or no longer require access. This also includes adding Users to replace Users that have left the Organization. Failure to do this can lead to significant delays in accessing an Organization.

In order to reinstate access to M-RETS, the Organization shall be required to present specific evidence that the managing employee is no longer with the Organization and the Organization maintains no other way to reset the password (e.g. accessing the former employee's email and utilizing the password reset function). M-RETS reserves the right to set the level of specific evidence, including but not limited to affidavits from executives maintaining the circumstances surrounding the departure of the employee and failure to transfer access to another User within the Organization.

Organizations may inactivate a User at any time for any reason. M-RETS may inactivate a User for failure to adhere to the Operating Procedures or Terms of Use.

Section 4.2: Accounts
M-RETS supports two Account types; Active Accounts and Retirement Accounts. Users can transfer Certificates to specific Accounts manually or automatically upon upload. Each Account has a unique identification number, similar to a banking system. Users may attach aliases to Accounts for ease of reference (e.g., by state, by product name, etc.).

Section 4.2.1: Active Accounts
An Organization can have one or more Active Account(s). An Active Account is the holding place for all active M-RETS Certificates. The Active Account is like a cash checking Account. M-RETS Certificates in Active Accounts are liquid and an Organization—depending on the type—may be able to transfer, retire, or export the Certificates.

If the Account has a Generating Unit(s) associated with it, the Active Account will be the first point of deposit for any M-RETS Certificates created that are associated with the Generating Unit(s) ID number.

Section 4.2.2: Deposits to the Active Account
There are four ways that M-RETS Certificates are deposited in an Active Account.

The Organization can transfer M-RETS Certificates into their Active Account from another of the Organization's Active Accounts.
The Organization can accept a transfer of Certificates from another M-RETS Organization.
The Certificates can be deposited into the Account by M-RETS based on verified generation data from a Generating Unit associated with the Active Account or through an adjustment approved by M-RETS in accordance with the Operating Procedures.
The Certificates can be deposited by M-RETS through the import process. If the Organization has more than one Active Account, the Organization can specify in each case the Active Account in which they want the Certificates deposited.
Section 4.2.3: Transfers from the Active Account
There are four ways to withdraw or remove M-RETS Certificates from an Active Account:

Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to another of one's own Accounts (e.g. retirement), or
Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to multiple of one's own Accounts, or
Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to the Active Account of another M-RETS Organization, or
Export the M-RETS Certificates out of M-RETS to another compatible tracking system.
Section 4.2.4: Functionality of an Active Account
In addition to being able to deposit and withdraw M-RETS Certificates from the Active Account, Organizations may view and sort their Certificates by a number of Certificate fields, generate reports about their Account, create additional Active Accounts, and transfer active M-RETS Certificates between Active Accounts.

Section 4.2.5: Retirement Accounts
An Organization may establish multiple Retirement Accounts at their discretion. A Retirement Account is a repository for M-RETS Certificates that the Organization wants to designate as retired. An Organization may want to retire Certificates for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to demonstrating compliance with a renewable mandate, retiring Certificates on behalf of green power customers, or making claims about the air quality benefits of the renewable Certificates. M-RETS Certificates in a Retirement Account are no longer transferable to another party and serve as an electronic proof of retirement.

Once an M-RETS Certificate is retired to a Retirement Account, those Certificates may not be transferred into any other Account, including another Retirement Account (i.e. if an Organization has multiple Retirement Accounts). The Retirement Account is effectively the last resting place for an M-RETS Certificate.

Section 4.2.6: Deposits to the Retirement Account
_See_Section 4.5.3: Retirement of Certificates

Section 4.2.7: Functionality of the Retirement Account
Retirement Accounts exist to hold Certificates permanently removed from circulation and serve as proof that the corresponding Certificates are subject to a voluntary or compliance claim or otherwise removed from circulation. Once an Organization completes the retirement, they cannot later change the retirement reason. This prevents the Certificate from being subject to a double claim. If, however, the Organization contacts M-RETS in writing within 24-hours from the time the Organization indicated the reason for retirement, M-RETS may grant a variance.

M-RETS will grant a variance within the 24-hour notice period when there is no likelihood a Certificate was claimed to be retired for multiple reasons and M-RETS does not suspect any nefarious intent or impropriety. If M-RETS believes there is any chance of double counting, they shall deny the request for a variance.

If an Organization notices an error in the selected retirement reason outside the 24-hour window, the Organization may contact M-RETS (systemadmin@mrets.org) in writing and ask that M-RETS grant a variance.1 M-RETS shall review all requests made outside of the 24-hour window and may grant a variance if they determine that the request is made in good faith and: that the Organization submitted their request for a variance in writing within a reasonable amount of time after discovering the error, that there is a legitimate reason for the change, and that there is no likelihood a Certificate was claimed to be retired for multiple reasons. M-RETS may submit the variance request—or send an email outlining the circumstances—to a state or provincial regulator should there be concern compliance with the variance request could result in potential double counting.

Section 4.2.8: Account Status
M-RETS classifies Accounts with the following statuses: Open, Closed, Archived, and Frozen.

Section 4.2.8.1: Open
An 'Open' status denotes the Account is ready to use and Users may Transfer or Retire Certificates to this Account. This status applies to both Active and Retirement Accounts.

Section 4.2.8.2: Closed
An Active Account can be set to a status of 'Closed' when no longer needed. Before closing, the Account must contain zero Certificates. Thus, the User must Transfer or Retire all Certificates from the Account prior to closing. An Account with a 'Closed' status denotes the Account can no longer accept Transfers. This status only applies to Active Accounts.

Section 4.2.8.3: Archived
When a Retirement Account is no longer needed, it can be set to a status of 'Archived'. An 'Archived' status denotes the Account cannot accept further Retirements. However, Retired Certificates remain in an 'Archived' Account. This status only applies to Retirement Accounts.

Section 4.2.8.4: Frozen
When a Retirement Account is part of a Program that has closed, it is set to a status of 'Frozen'. A 'Frozen' status denotes the Account cannot accept further Retirements. However, Retired Certificates remain in an 'Frozen' Account. This status only applies to Retirement Accounts.

Section 4.3: Generators
M-RETS defines renewable generation as energy generated by a facility that any state, province, or territory participating in M-RETS considers renewable by law or policy. M-RETS issues one electronic Certificate for each MWh of renewable energy produced by Generators registered and approved in M-RETS. To ensure that double-counting does not occur, Generators participating in M-RETS must report 100% of their generation output in M-RETS. M-RETS maintains a list of state definitions of renewable energy located in the M-RETS compliance footprint here.

Any Generator that delivers energy into North America may register in M-RETS. Other states, provinces, territories, countries or Generators outside of North America may request to use M-RETS subject to the approval of the M-RETS Board. In addition, M-RETS will track other generation forms (e.g. nuclear generation) or other environmental attributes. Requests to add a generator outside North America or to track other generation forms should be made in writing to the M-RETS System Administrator (systemadmin@mrets.org) and M-RETS leadership listed here.

M-RETS may issue Certificates for any energy production serving a load that the grid would otherwise serve if not for the Generator. M-RETS will not create Certificates for generation supplying station service/parasitic load.

For customer-sited distributed Generators, the original data source for reporting total energy production must be from metering at the AC output of an inverter, adjusted to reflect the energy delivered into either the transmission or distribution grid. In the absence of a meter measuring production as described above (i.e. if there is no meter at the inverter), the original data source for reporting total energy production must be from metering placed to measure only the hourly positive generation flowing to the distribution system, adjusted to reflect the energy delivered into either the transmission or distribution grid. Test energy is not treated differently and must also be delivered to the transmission or distribution grid.

M-RETS defines a Generator as an electric generating facility consisting of one or more Generating Units with the same essential generation characteristics with a single meter that measures the output.

Section 4.3.1: Registration of a Generator
All Generator Owners must first establish an Organization subscription and then register the Generating Unit(s) with M-RETS. As part of the Generator Registration Agreement, the User must attest that this Unit is not registered in any other Registry. Generating Unit(s) that are jointly owned must privately appoint a single Organization where the Generator will reside.

To register the Generating Unit(s), the owner of the Generating Unit or the Responsible Party must submit to M-RETS the following:

A completed on-line Generator registration form containing information related to the characteristics of the Generating Unit and associated meter.
If applicable: A completed Schedule A from the M-RETS Terms of Use outlining the Generator Owner's Designation of Responsible Party.
Any documentation requested by M-RETS to verify the registration information
It is helpful for Generators to include a Generator interconnection agreement that helps support the registration information. See Acceptable Documentation in Appendix A: Generator Static Data Fields.
Providing a Generators EIA Entity ID which is an official, unique identification numbers assigned by EIA can expedite the approval process. The EIA Entity ID is required for all Generators over 1 MW in the United States and may be found by accessing the report here.
If this Generator will use MISO as the reporting entity, please fill out and upload this form in the Generator documents. It is important that the form reflects the correct MISO node.
The Generator registration process will include both mandatory and optional data entry and M-RETS shall verify all data prior to making a Generator Active.

NOTE: Registration with M-RETS does not imply or confer acceptance into or eligibility for any state's Renewable Portfolio Standard program.

A Visual Guide to the Generator Registration Process

Section 4.3.1.1: Static Data in M-RETS
Static data fields describe the physical attributes of the Generating Unit. Users provide this data to M-RETS during the Generator registration process, and the subsequent update processes described below.

M-RETS shall verify all static data before including it in the System. Appendix A: Generator Static Data Fields lists the method of verification for each data field. In addition, M-RETS may conduct site visits to further verify the information as needed.

Section 4.3.2: Verification of Static Data Submitted During Generator Registration
Upon completion of the Generator registration process, the User represents and warrants to M-RETS that all information for this Generator shall be true, complete, and correct to the best of its knowledge, information, and belief. Any changes after submission may result in a delay in the approval process. The Generator approval process begins once the Generator is submitted from a draft status.

In the event data submitted is inaccurate or if there is a discrepancy between the information submitted during the on-line registration process and the materials provided to verify the information, M-RETS will notify the registrant of the issue. A process of either correcting the data in the online registration form, withdrawing the registration, or providing proof that the information on the registration form is correct will ensue between M-RETS and the registrant until M-RETS is satisfied that the information provided meets M-RETS approval standards.

Section 4.3.3: M-RETS Interaction with State Commissions and Certification of Facilities for State Programs
M-RETS shall be responsible for verifying any information submitted to M-RETS during the Generating Unit Registration Process. Each individual state will be responsible for determining whether a Generating Unit qualifies for a state program. The State Commissions may use the information collected and verified by M-RETS to conduct this determination. State regulatory commissions have the option of asking M-RETS to send them an electronic version of the registration information for all Generating Units in their jurisdiction or claiming to be eligible for any state programs. If the state commission has exercised this option, M-RETS will send an electronic message to the designated contact at the state commission each time M-RETS registers and verifies such a Generating Unit. The state commissions reserve the right to conduct site visits or request additional information from a Generator to determine whether the facility meets all the requirements.

Section 4.3.4: Multi-Fuel Generators
A multi-fuel Generator is one that can produce energy using more than one fuel type, where the quantity of each of the fuels used is greater than 1% annually on a total heat input basis, excluding fuels used for start-up. A multi-fuel Generator can be a Generating Unit that uses a renewable fuel with a fossil fuel or one that uses multiple types of renewable fuels. Such facilities must register with M-RETS as a multi-fuel Generator. If the Generator Owner or M-RETS cannot measure or calculate the relative quantities of electricity production from each fuel, the Generator is not eligible to register as a multi-fuel Generating Unit in M-RETS.

M-RETS only creates Certificates for renewable fuel types. Each Certificate issued for a multi-fuel Generating Unit will reflect only one fuel source. The total number of Certificates issued for a fuel type in a reporting period will be proportional to the electric output from that fuel type for that reporting period.

The Generator or its owning Organization must maintain supporting documentation related to the derivation of the proportion of electric output per fuel type for each month at the generation facility for a minimum of two years from the date of submission to M-RETS. M-RETS may require copies of such calculations and supporting documentation will be subject to audit by M-RETS, state regulators, or their agents. M-RETS shall treat as Confidential Information all data submitted to or audited by M-RETS subject to the requirements of this paragraph not contained in reports available to the public.

Section 4.3.4.1: Allocating Output for Each Fuel Source
For purposes of creating M-RETS Certificates reflecting the fuel source mix of multi-fuel Generating Units, the proportion of Certificates attributable to each fuel source shall be determined consistent with the following rule. For renewable fuels co-fired with fossil fuels or using fossil fuels for startup or supplemental firing: In each month, the Certificates for each fuel in such multi-fuel Generating Units will be created in proportion to the ratio of the net heat content of each fuel consumed to the net heat content of all fuel consumed in that month, adjusted to reflect differential heat rates for different fuels, if applicable.

Upon registration, all multi-fuel Generators must submit to M-RETS a report prepared by a licensed professional engineer containing documentation for measuring and verifying the quantities of each fuel type, the method of determining the net heat content and moisture content of each fuel source, and the heat rate of the Generator, if applicable. M-RETS will share this documentation with state or provincial regulators upon request of the regulator.

Section 4.3.5: Multiple Units on a Single Meter
Generating Units register on a meter basis. In the case where there is more than one Generating Unit associated with a single meter, the Generator Owner or Responsible Party can register more than one Generating Units under one registration if, and only if, all the Generating Units have the same essential generation characteristics.

If the Generating Units associated with a single meter do not have the exact same essential generation characteristics, the Generator Owner or Responsible Party has two choices—they can either install a new meter(s) such that all Generating Units associated with a single meter have the same generation characteristics, or they can designate a percentage allocation on an MWh output basis for each different Generating Unit(s) associated with the meter.

Example: If there are two Generating Units (a biomass direct combustion Generating Unit and a biomass gasification unit and technology type is considered an essential characteristic) associated with one meter, the registrant would indicate that X% of the output as measured at the meter comes from the direct combustion unit and Y% comes from the gasification unit.

Section 4.3.6: Distributed Generation Aggregation
For small (&lt;1 MW) Generating Units, M-RETS will allow aggregation ("Distributed Generation Aggregation") of Units not metered together and which do not share the same location, but which are located within the same state or province, and which otherwise share the same essential generation characteristics identified in Appendix B: Fuel Type & Fuel Source.

Aggregated Generators must meet the following criteria:

The M-RETS State/Province programs allows for aggregation if an eligibility is sought; and
The Aggregated Units do not exceed a total nameplate capacity of 1 MW.
M-RETS may require documentation to verify each Aggregated Unit and generation data including proof of the right to registration and proof that each unit is within acceptable proximity to the other units.

Section 4.3.7: Annual Review of Generators
M-RETS requires Users to update/review Generators once a year during the month of January to ensure correct information. M-RETS will email Users with the requisite permissions as well as prompt them within the System to complete the review.

It is the User's requirement to confirm that they represent and warrant to M-RETS that all information for their Generator shall be true, complete, and correct to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief.

M-RETS requires that Organizations review and accept all Generator data by January 31

st
. Failure to complete the annual review for each Generator in an Organization by January 31

st
each year will result in the loss of access to the Organization until a User with proper permissions reviews and confirms all of the data for every Generator in the Organization.

Section 4.3.8: Changes to Static Data
In addition to the annual update, Users must notify M-RETS of the following that have the effect of changing static data tracked by M-RETS within 30 calendar days of the effective date and/or knowledge of the change:

A change in fuel type at a Generating Unit, and the date on which the change occurred.
A change in Generating Unit ownership (_See_Section 4.3.12: Changing the Organization to which the Generator is Associated).
A change to Generator eligibility for any programs or certification tracked by M-RETS. Before M-RETS adds an eligibility to a Generator, M-RETS will verify the Generator meets the states eligibility requirements. In the case where a state requires preapproval, M-RETS will require the appropriate documentation and reserves the right to verify this information with the appropriate state, province or independent certifier. A User may remove an eligibility at any time.
A change to any of the "essential generating characteristics".
M-RETS can remove Generators for cause, including willful misrepresentation of static data. M-RETS may rely on the M-RETS dispute resolution process (SeeM-RETS Terms of Use) to address such situations, and M-RETS will accept no liability for Generator misrepresentations. M-RETS reserves the right to take appropriate action in consultation with the M-RETS Board to respond to willful misrepresentation of static data, including but not limited to withholding issuing Certificates, Inactivating an Organization associated with a particular Generating Unit, or withholding participation in M-RETS for Generating Units that have willfully misrepresented static data.

Section 4.3.9:
[ANNOTATION:

BY 'Sean Darling' ON '2019-09-17T11:47:00'SD NOTE: 'REWRITE'] Generator Inactivation

To ensure data integrity, unused or retired Generators are set to an 'Inactive' status. Only M-RETS can Inactivate a Generator. Setting a Generator to Inactive prevents any subsequent generation uploads and Certificate creation by the Generator. Inactivating a Generator does not affect previously issued Certificates.

Section 4.3.10: Generator Suspension
If M-RETS has cause to suspend the Generating Unit's participation in M-RETS, Certificate production will cease until M-RETS approves a re-instatement of the Generator. Suspension of a Generator does not affect Certificates previously issued in accordance with the M-RETS Terms of Use and Operating Procedures.

Section 4.3.11: Generator Termination
If M-RETS has cause to permanently terminate the Generating Unit's participation in M-RETS, M-RETS will cease any further production of Certificates, and the Generator will be inaccessible. Termination of a Generator does not affect Certificates previously issued in accordance with the M-RETS Terms of Use and Operating Procedures.

Section 4.3.12: Changing the Organization to which the Generator is Associated
If the Generator Owner or Responsible Party ("Transferor") wants to change the Organization to which a Generating Unit is associated, they can do so by requesting the change from M-RETS in writing or via email.

The Transferor must confirm the following:

The Organization Name and Organization I.D. of the Transferor.
The Generator Name and M-RETS I.D.
The effective date of the change and the last vintage that should be issued to the Transferor.
The Transferee must confirm the following:

The Organization Name and Organization I.D.
The Generator Name and M-RETS I.D.
The Account Name and Account I.D. to which the Generator will initially issue Certificates upon competition of the change.
The effective date of the change and the first vintage that should be issued to the Transferee.
Any changes to the static Generator data (e.g. new Reporting Entity, Eligibilities).
Certificates from generation that occurred up to the day the Organization change takes effect will be issued into the Organization that the Generating Unit was associated with at the time the generation occurred.

For example, if the Generator owner changes the Organization to which a given Generating Unit is associated with from Organization A to Organization B, and the change is effective on March 1, then the Certificates from generation that occurred prior to March 1, will be deposited into Organization A (even though the date of Certificate deposit will be after March 1, because of the lag time between generation occurrence and Certificate issuance.)

There cannot be any lapse in time where the Generator is not associated with an M-RETS Organization. If there is a period when the Generator is not associated with an M-RETS Organization, M-RETS will treat this as an Inactivation/Reactivation of the Generator instead of a change of Organization.

Any fractional remainder MWhs (i.e. any kWh) will transfer to the new owner of the Generator.

Section 4.3.13: Assignment of Rights of Registration – Designation of Responsible Party
The owner of a Generating Unit or Responsible Party may assign the right to register the Generating Unit(s) in M-RETS to an M-RETS Organization for the purposes of allowing that party the ability to control and manage the disposition of any M-RETS Certificates resulting from the operation of the Generating Unit(s). This assignment of registration rights will give the designated Organization full and sole management and authority over the transactions and activities related to the Generating Unit within M-RETS. For the purposes of M-RETS, this party is the Responsible Party for that Generating Unit.

M-RETS will require both parties to confirm an assignment of registration rights and the date the assignment will be effective, and the termination date if applicable.

Section 4.3.14: Termination of Rights of Registration
The Generator Owner or the Responsible Party may terminate the Rights of Registration subject to confirmation by M-RETS that both the Generator Owner and Responsible Party agree to the termination. The User will file the Generating Unit Termination form with M-RETS. The form specifies who the new Responsible Party with the Rights of Registration is and the date the change in registration will occur. Termination of Rights of Registration has the effect of deregistering the Generating Unit from M-RETS. Thus, no new Certificates will be issued from that generating upon the effective date of the termination. _See_Section 4.3.12: Changing the Organization to which the Generator is Associated for additional information.

Section 4.3.15: Changing Rights of Registration
When changing the Rights of Registration, the disposition of the Certificates from that Generating Unit will follow the rules in Section 4.3.13: Assignment of Rights of Registration – Designation of Responsible Party. This function applies equally to the Generator Owner or to a Responsible Party, meaning that the Responsible Party can change the Rights of Registration to another party.

When changing the Rights of Registration, M-RETS will confirm that both parties (the Generator Owner or current Responsible Party and the new Responsible Party) agree to the change. If the Generator Owner or Responsible Party wants to change the Organization to which a Generating Unit is associated, they can do so by filing the Generating Unit Transfer Form with M-RETS. The form specifies who the new Responsible Party with the Rights of Registration is, and the date the change in registration will occur. There cannot be any lapse in time where the Generating Unit is not associated with an M-RETS Organization. If there is a period when the Generating Unit is not associated with an M-RETS Organization, M-RETS will treat this as a deregistration/re-registration of the Generating Unit.

In addition, the User must review—and update if necessary—the basic Generator Registration data when the Right of Registration is changed from one party to another.
