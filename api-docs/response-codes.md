# Response Codes

Example of response code docs: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/response-codes

The standard Twitter API returns HTTP status codes in addition to JSON-based error codes and messages.

## HTTP Status Codes

<span style="color:red">!! I stole these from Twitter. Should be updated with our codes. !!</span>

The M-RETS API attempts to return appropriate HTTP status codes for every request.

| Code | Text                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|  400 | Bad Request           | The request was invalid or cannot be otherwise served. An accompanying error message will explain further. Requests without authentication are considered invalid and will yield this response.                                                                                                            |

|  403 | Forbidden             | The request is understood, but it has been refused or access is not allowed. An accompanying error message will explain why. This code is used when requests are being denied due to update limits . Other reasons for this status being returned are listed alongside the error codes in the table below. |
|  404 | Not Found             | The URI requested is invalid or the resource requested, such as a user, does not exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|  422 | Unprocessable Entity  | Returned when the data is unable to be processed (for example, if an image uploaded to POST account / update_profile_banner is not valid, or the JSON body of a request is badly-formed).                                                                                                                  |
|  429 | Too Many Requests     | Returned when a request cannot be served due to the app's rate limit having been exhausted for the resource. See Rate Limiting.                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  500 | Internal Server Error | Something is broken. This is usually a temporary error, for example in a high load situation or if an endpoint is temporarily having issues.

## Error Messages

M-RETS API error messages are returned in JSON format. For example, an error might look like this:

``` insert an example here ```

## Error Codes

<span style="color:red">!! I stole these from Twitter. Should be updated with our codes. !!</span>

In addition to descriptive error text, error messages contain machine-parseable codes. While the text for an error message may change, the codes will stay the same.

The following table describes the codes which may appear when working with the standard API (note that the Ads API and some other resource families may present additional error codes). If an error response is not listed in the table, fall back to examining the HTTP status codes above in order to determine the best way to address the issue.
