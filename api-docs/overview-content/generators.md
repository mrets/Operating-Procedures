# Generators

M-RETS defines a Generator as an electricity generating facility consisting of one or more generating units with the same essential generation characteristics and a single certified meter measures the output.
 
All Generator Owners must first establish an Organization subscription and then register the generating unit(s) with M-RETS. As part of the Generator Registration Agreement, the User must attest that this unit is not registered in any other Registry. Generating Units that are jointly owned must privately appoint a single organization where the generator will reside.
 
The generator registration process includes the submittal of extensive information related to a Generator. A subset of this information is required to submit a Generator for Review. The System Administrator verifies all generator data in M-RETS. Static data fields describe the physical attributes of the generating unit. This information that users provide during the Generator registration process should not change throughout the life of the Generator. M-RETS shall verify all static data through cross-referencing information with other official sources. In addition, M-RETS may conduct site visits to further verify the information as needed.
