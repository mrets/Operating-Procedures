# Programs

The Program feature helps regulators, regulated entities, and organizations with their own internal programs to more efficiently manage the complexity of various programs. The Program feature allows regulators as well as Organizations the opportunity to set up rulesets that prevent retirements of Certificates outside the parameters set to a specified Retirement Account.
Users may create rules around any subset or all the following attribute areas, however, the System does not require a ruleset to utilize this feature nor is this feature restricted to compliance programs:

- Vintage Start [requires Certificate vintage to be within a certain date]
- Vintage End [requires Certificate vintage to be within a certain date]
- Eligibilities [requires Certificates to have AT LEAST one of the selected eligibilities]
- Generator Location [Generator must originate in one of the selected state/provinces]
- Fuel Types [Certificates must meet AT LEAST one fuel type]
- Generators [Certificates must come from AT LEAST one of the selected Generators]
- 
## Establishing a Program
Users can create a Program for internal use or can invite other M-RETS Organizations to participate.
Any User within a General Account Subscription Organization that has Program manage permissions can create an Internal Program. Only Organizations that create Internal Programs can use and view the Program. Any Account created as part of the Internal Program will be subject to the associated Program Ruleset.
The Administrator of an External Program can invite an unlimited number of other M-RETS Organizations to participate in a Program. All participants will receive a notification inviting them to participate in the Program. Prior to becoming active Program participants, the invitee must accept the invitation.
