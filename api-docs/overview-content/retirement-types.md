# Retirement Types

When completing a retirement, users must select the appropropriate Retirement Type. With each Retirement Type, the user must select one of potentially several relevant Retirement Reasons. See the Retirement Options entity for more information on valid options.

The available options are classified as either "Compliance" or "Voluntary". These different types of retirements come with different associated costs. See the (M-RETS Fee Page)[https://www.mrets.org/m-rets-fees/] for more information on our current fees.
