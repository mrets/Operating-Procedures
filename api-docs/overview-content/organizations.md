# Organizations Overview

An Organization is a company or entity registered in M-RETS. An Organization must have at least one registered user, but can have an unlimited number of users. 

Account (Subscription) Type
An Organization registers with the M-RETS with a selected Subscription or Account Type. This Account type determines what an organization can do in the system and what their annual subscription fee is. See our the latest [M-RETS fee schedule](https://www.mrets.org/m-rets-fees/) for more information.

* Pending: An Organization that has requested access to M-RETS, but has not been accepted.
