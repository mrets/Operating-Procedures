# Users Overview

Every M-RETS Organization has a User List, compiling both Active and Inactive Users.  A User can be a member of one or many Organizations. M-RETS expressly prohibits the sharing of User credentials. M-RETS requires every person that logs into the System to have their own separate User login credentials. M-RETS tracks the specific activities of each User through the unique User ID and password.

Every User in M-RETS has customizable permissions for each Organization that have access to. Users can be set as Manage, Read Only, or No Access. Only a User with Manage permissions for the Organization can change permissions. The abilities of each level are as follows:
* Manage: Ability to view and edit the topic
* Read Only: Ability to solely view the topic
* No Access: Inability to view or edit the topic

It is the Organization's responsibility to make sure the User list is current. This includes inactivating Users when they leave the company or no longer require access. This also includes adding Users to replace Users that have left the Organization. Failure to do this can lead to significant delays in accessing an Organization.

Organizations may inactivate a User at any time for any reason. M-RETS may inactivate a User for failure to adhere to the Operating Procedures or Terms of Use.
