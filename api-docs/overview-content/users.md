# Users Overview

Users in the M-RETS System have passwords that allow them to access the system. MFA is also managed at the level of the User. M-RETS tracks the specific activities of each User through the unique User ID and password.

Users can belong to one or many Organizations. See the `User Organization` entity for more information.
