# Generator aggregates

Generator aggregates or aggregate meter groups occur when there is more than one Generator Unit associated with a single Revenue-Quality Meter. The Account Holder determines the percentage of generation to each unit and may update this split.

The Qualified Reporting Entity, or QRE, is a relationship to this group.
