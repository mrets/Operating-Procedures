# Generation Entry Overview

Generation Entries and Generation Entry Lines are used to model generation data in the M-RETS. The Generation Entry could have multiple Generation Entry Lines if sa CSV upload was used to submit the data and it contained multiple lines of generation corresponding to different Generators.

The Generation Entry Log in the M-RETS UI is a list of Generation Entry Lines. Each time M-RETS receives generation data for a generator, the date and quantity of MWhs is posted to the Generation Log.
