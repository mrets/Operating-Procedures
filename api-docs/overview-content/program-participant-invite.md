# Program / Market Participant Invite

## Participating in a Program

The Administrator of an External Program can invite an unlimited number of other M-RETS Organizations to participate in a Program. All participants will receive a notification inviting them to participate in the Program. Prior to becoming active Program participants, the invitee must accept the invitation.

Once an Organization accepts an invitation to participate in a Program, the participating Organization must create a new Retirement Account and link the Account to the Program. As Certificates are retired into this Account, they will automatically appear on both the Program Administrator and the participantâ€™s Program dashboard. This dashboard is tailored to only show relevant information for their Program.

If a User attempts to retire Certificates that do not match the predetermined criteria of the Program, the System blocks the retirement. This prevents the retirement of incorrect Certificates.
