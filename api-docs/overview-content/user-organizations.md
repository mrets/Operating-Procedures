# User Organizations Overview

Every M-RETS Organization has a User List. A User can also belong to multiple organizations in the M-RETS System. The User Organization entity is where the specific attributes associated with a User’s access to a specific organization can be found. This includes a User’s individual access permissions for an Organization and their status.

Every User in M-RETS has customizable permissions. Users can be set as Manage, Read Only, or No Access. Only a User with Manage permissions for the Organization can change permissions. The abilities of each level are as follows:
* Manage: Ability to view and edit the topic
* Read Only: Ability to solely view the topic
* No Access: Inability to view or edit the topic

M-RETS classifies Users with the following statuses: Active and Inactive
* Active: An Active User has access to the associated Organization
* Inactive: An Inactive User has no access to the associated Organization
