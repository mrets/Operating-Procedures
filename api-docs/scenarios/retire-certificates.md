# Retire Certificates

## Use Case

Certificates are retired when the owner wants to make some kind of environmental claim. M-RETS supports a variety of Retirement Types and Reasons.

## Notes About the Entity

Retirements in the M-RETS system are represented on a basic level by User Transactions and Transaction Details. The User Transaction captures important information about the retirement such as the transaction type, the date the transaction was started/completed, who started/completed the transaction, and important details related to the retirement.

A retirement User Transaction could have one or many associated transaction details that represent the individual certificate quantities that were involved in the retirement. For example, if a user were to select 3 rows to be retired in the UI, that User Transaction would have three associated Transaction Details.

A Retirement Transaction only involves one step. A user initiates a retirement and it will immediately be completed requiring no additional steps.


## Initiating a Retirement

### Selecting Certificates

All transactions are initiated in the same way. One or many Certificate Quantities are specified.

    POST /v1/public/rec/user_transactions

On the User Transaction object, the value of `retirement_type` should match the `name` from the selected `retirement_option`.
The `retirement_reason` values should match one of the values from the `reason` field on the selected `retirement_option` (if available)The `retired_to` from the user transaction requires a State/Province abbreviation from the specify country on the `retired_to` from the `retirement_option` (if the value is `all` then all Countries are allowed).

The M-RETS platform also sends out email notifications to both the sending organization and destination organization.

Email notification settings can be viewed and updated in the M-RETS user interface by clicking on the Org in the upper right corner, then navigating to the User table.
