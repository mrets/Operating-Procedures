# Participate in a Market

## Use Case

There is one type of certificate transfers:
* A market transfer from one organization to another. User denoting a sale or change in ownership.

## Notes About the Entity

Transfers in the M-RETS system are represented on a basic level by User Transactions and Transaction Details. The User Transaction captures important information about the transfer such as the transaction type, date the transaction was started/completed, and who started/completed the transaction.

A transfer User Transaction could have one or many associated transaction details that represent the individual certificate quantities that were involved in the transaction. So say in the UI, a user were to select 3 rows and complete an Market Transfer, that User Transaction would have three associated Transaction Details.

Market transfers only involve one step. A user initiates a transfer and it will immediately be completed requiring no additional steps.

The market transfer will deposited the certificates on the receiving organization's Purchased account.
