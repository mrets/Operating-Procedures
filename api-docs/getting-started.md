# Getting Started

M-RETS API provides tools and resources that enable our users to complete many tasks on the tracking system platform.

This page describes what’s possible to build with our available tools and APIs and how to get the access and information that you need to get started.

We regularly update and improve the experience and resources available in the API docs. To stay informed of any updates, sign-up for our newsletter [here](https://www.mrets.org/api/).

## What can be done with the M-RETS API?

* Retiring certificates for voluntary or compliance purposes
* Participating in a program

## What is required to use the M-RETS API?

M-RETs requires that all API users be part of a registered organization with a General Account subscription in good standing.
