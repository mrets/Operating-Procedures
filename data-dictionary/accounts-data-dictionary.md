Once deposited in a retirement account, RECs can't be moved. 'active': Type assigned to accounts holding RECs that are active.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Status       | status                     | Field specifying the activities that can occur in an account. <br>'open': Can be assigned to either active or retirement accounts. Specifies that an account can accept transfers or retirements. <br>'closed': Can only be assigned to an active account that does not contain any RECs. Once closed, an account can't accept any transfers., <br>'archived': Can be assigned to any retirement account. Once archived, an account can no longer accept new retired RECs. <br>'frozen': Can be assigned to a retirement account. A retirement account is frozen when the program that it is associated with passes its date of closure. This status specifies that it is perhaps being reviewed by a regulator, but can no longer accept new retirements because the program deadline has passed. |
