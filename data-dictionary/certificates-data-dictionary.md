| Vintage                | vintage                              | Value is based on the month of the final day of the associated generation period.                                                                                                                       |
| Serial Number Base     | serial\_number\_base                   | Character string containing the generator ID, vintage, state, and a randomly generated string of characters. Sequence is unique to a particular certificate.                                            |
| Serial Number Start    | serial\_number\_start                  | The first certificate number in an issuance group sharing the same attributes.                                                                                                                          |
| Serial Number End      | serial\_number\_end                    | The last certificate number in an issuance group sharing the same attributes.                                                                                                                           |
| Quantity               | quantity                             | The total number of certificates issued as part of vintage from the same generator fuel.                                                                                                                |
| Import Source          | import_source                        | The tracking system that exported the certificates if a quantity was imported from an external tracking system.                                                                                         |
| Certificate Quantities | relationship: certificate_quantities | The associated batches of certificates that were part of the same issuance vintage. Starts as a single certificate quantity, then is split into smaller batches as the certificates are transacted on.  |   
| Generator              | relationship: generator              | The generating facility that produced the certificate.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Generator Fuel         | relationship: generator_fuel         | The specific energy source ([Fuel Type](https://mrets.github.io/Operating-Procedures/appendixb1)) for the certificates.|
| Eligibilities         | relationship: eligibilities         |The eligilibity tags on the Generator. These tags show which, if any, state/province RPS programs for which the Generator is eligible. |
