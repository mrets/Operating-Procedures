Section 4.8: API
----------------

M-RETS offers an application programming interface (API) to give
Organizations with a General Account Subscription the ability to access
M-RETS data from outside of the M-RETS Portal. Uses for this feature
include, but are not limited to, creating an automated process to send a
transfer or to pull report information. Organizations need to request an
API access key before using the API. M-RETS can also provide access to a
sandbox environment to test the API without affecting live production
data in M-RETS. M-RETS encourages all users to use the sandbox
environment prior to utilizing the M-RETS API in the production system.

Documentation for the API is accessed through the M-RETS portal. Click
on the "Documentation" tab located in the left nav menu to view a list
of available calls and technical specifications. The documentation is
interactive and allows for the testing of API calls right in the
interface.

More information on our API can be found in our [Terms of
Use](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MRETS-Terms-of-Use-Updated-11-28-2018.pdf).
