### Section 4.5.3: Retirement of Certificates

Certificate Retirement is an action taken by the User to remove a Certificate from circulation. M-RETS is not responsible for ensuring that Users Retire Certificates for voluntary or compliance purposes. M-RETS requires all Users to initiate and complete all retirements. M-RETS maintains an integrated online help guide that Users can access [here](https://help.mrets.org/en/).

M-RETS has a pull-down menu of options for acceptable retirement reasons that the Organization must select to complete the retirement. The options will be consistent with regulatory programs and any voluntary programs or voluntary market activities. Users shall notify M-RETS if they would like to add a new type of voluntary or compliance retirement reason.
