### Section 4.3.6: Changes to Static Data

In addition to the annual update, Users must notify M-RETS of the following that have the effect of changing static data tracked by M-RETS within 30 calendar days of the effective date and/or knowledge of the change:

<ol>
  <li>A change in feedstock and/or Resource type at a Generating Unit, and the date on which the change occurred.</li>
  <li>A change in Generating Unit ownership (*See* Section 4.3.10: Changing the Organization to which the Generator is Associated).</li>
  <li>A change to Generator eligibility for any programs or certification tracked by M-RETS. A User may remove an eligibility at any time.</li>
  <li>A change to any of the "essential generating characteristics".</li>
  </ol>

These changes will put the affected generator into Pending Status. Before M-RETS places the Generator back into Active status, thus updating the static data, M-RETS will verify the Generator meets the changes, such as Program eligibility requirements. In the case where a state requires preapproval, M-RETS will require the appropriate documentation and reserves the right to verify this information with the appropriate state, province, or independent certification body.

M-RETS can remove Generators for cause, including willful misrepresentation of static data. M-RETS may rely on the M-RETS dispute resolution process ([See M-RETS Terms of Use](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MRETS-Terms-of-Use-RNG-AND-REC-Effective-January-1-2020.pdf)) to address such situations, and M-RETS will accept no liability for Generator misrepresentations. M-RETS reserves the right to take appropriate action in consultation with the M-RETS Board to respond to willful misrepresentation of static data, including but not limited to withholding issuing Certificates, inactivating an Organization associated with a particular Generating Unit, or withholding participation in M-RETS for Generating Units that have willfully misrepresented static data.
