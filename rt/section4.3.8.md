### Section 4.3.8: Generator Suspension

If M-RETS has cause to suspend the Generating Utility's participation in M-RETS, Certificate production will cease until M-RETS approves a reinstatement of the Generator. Suspension of a Generator does not affect Certificates previously issued in accordance with the M-RETS Terms of Use and Operating Procedures.
