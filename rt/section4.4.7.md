### Section 4.4.7: Carbon Pathways

M-RETS supports tracking one or more Carbon Pathways that provide a Carbon Intensity ("CI") tracking. While tracking CI **is not** mandatory, M-RETS encourages generators to submit and track a CI whenever practicable. CI values are expressed in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (*gCO~2~e/MJ*) as well as (*gCO~2~e/Dth*). M-RETS supports either a Full Lifecycle CI or a Partial Lifecycle CI.

<ol>
  <li>Full Lifecycle Carbon Intensity - takes into account the GHG emissions associated with all of the steps of producing, transporting, and consuming a fuel.</li>
  <li>Partial Lifecycle Carbon Intensity -- takes into account the GHG emissions associated with all of the steps of producing a fuel up to the Injection Point or interconnection into the distribution system or interstate transportation system.</li>
  </ol>

Lifecycle CI scores for RNG require an assessment of all sources and sinks of GHGs---from production to end-use---and dividing these emissions by the energy in the gas at a specific point in that lifecycle. The resulting value is measured on a carbon dioxide equivalency basis. This is important because Methane is a short-lived climate pollutant that, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is up to 84 times as potent a GHG as carbon dioxide.[[3]](#_ftn3)

The benefits of using lifecycle CI accounting are that it captures the upstream methane reduction benefits of renewable thermal projects and reduces the GHG value for project proportionate to the distance the thermal resource must travel (e.g., transportation associated emissions including pipeline leakage) and whether the end-use has any associated emissions (e.g., thermal combustion). This feature allows M-RETS users to maximize GHG emission reductions should users seek to do that.

Upon retirement, users may select an existing partial or full lifecycle CI to select. The selected CI will remain as part of the permanent retirement record. The retirement flow does not require the selection of a CI; however, it may be required as part of a voluntary or compliance program.

Partial CI scores may be helpful for generators that have not identified an end-use buyer prior to uploading generation. A future buyer may be able to use the CI provided to calculate a full lifecycle analysis outside M-RETS. Â 

The alternative to using lifecycle accounting is to use source-based accounting similar to that used in national and state-level GHG emission inventories.[[4]](#_ftn4) Source-based accounting is simpler in that it focuses only on the greenhouse gases emitted at the point of end combustion of the gas and usually makes the assumption that all bio-derived fuels are "carbon neutral" (i.e., have zero net CO2 emissions since CO2 created at the point of combustion are offset by the uptake of CO2 when the biological material that was the source of the RNG was grown). Using such a source-based system does not account for upstream methane effects (both reductions when the RNG is created and leakage as the gas is transported to the end market).

M-RETS does not require Generator Owners to update the Carbon Pathways at specific intervals. Instead, each Carbon Pathway has a date range. The first date in the range represents the verification date by an independent third party. The last date in the range represents the last day that certificates can be issued with that Carbon Pathway. Certificates issued following the last day of the date range will no longer maintain the Carbon Pathway. Should a state or provincial regulatory scheme require annual updates, the eligibility flag will be removed if valid Carbon Pathways are not maintained by the generator and/or the specific Thermal Resource and Feedstock. For a generator to maintain the IRE eligibility the Generator must at a minimum update each Carbon Pathway associated with a generator annually.
