## Section 4.3: Generators

M-RETS defines renewable generation as energy generated by a facility that any state, province, or territory participating in M-RETS considers renewable by law or policy. M-RETS issues one electronic Certificate for each dekatherm ("Dth") of renewable energy[[1]](#_ftn1) produced by Generators registered and approved in M-RETS. [[2]](#_ftn2) To ensure that double-counting does not occur, Generators participating in M-RETS must report 100% of their generation output in M-RETS. M-RETS maintains this requirement even if the Generator sells the remaining volumes into a regulatory program (e.g., a state Low Carbon Fuel Standard ("LCFS") or the [EPA Renewable Fuel Standard](https://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-program) ("RFS") that may not use MRETS). [[3]](#_ftn3) A Generator that sells any volume into a voluntary or regulatory program that does not utilize M-RETS in an official or unofficial capacity must use an IRE for all data reported to M-RETS. Data on generation for non-M-RETS programs will remain only visible to the Generator Owner and recognized regulatory staff.

Any Generator that produces non-electric thermal energy within North America may register in the M-RETS Renewable Thermal Registry. This includes, but is not limited to: biogas, renewable natural gas ("RNG") also known as biomethane, solar thermal, renewable gas (i.e. hydrogen produced using renewable energy),[[4]](#_ftn4) heat produced by a combined heat and power system using recognized renewable feedstock (e.g., biomass, wood waste, etc.), ground source heating and cooling pumps,[[5]](#_ftn5) and geothermal energy. Organizations may create and retire Certificates if, and only if, the end-use is for a recognized vehicle fuel program such as the LCFS or RFS and those programs publicly declare their acceptance and recognition of M-RETS as an official compliance tool.  Any other Generator may request to participate, however, that request is subject to approval by the M-RETS Board. Other states, provinces, territories, countries, or Generators outside of North America may request to use M-RETS subject to the approval of the M-RETS Board.

Any generator that delivers non-electric renewable energy into North America may register in the M-RETS Renewable Thermal Registry. Any other generator may request to participate, however, that request is subject to approval by the M-RETS Board. Other states, provinces, territories, countries, or generators outside of North America may request to use the M-RETS system subject to the approval of the M-RETS Board. In addition, M-RETS will track other generation forms (e.g., geothermal) or other Environmental Attributes.
