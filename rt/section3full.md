# Section 3: Establishing an M-RETS Organization

Participation in M-RETS is voluntary, though some states or provinces may require participation in M-RETS for purposes of regulatory program compliance. Any party that registers with M-RETS and pays the applicable fees may establish an Organization in the System. There is no limit to the number of separate Organizations a company or individual may establish. Registrants will provide necessary Organization registration information, such as username, address, contact info, etc. to M-RETS through a secure webpage on M-RETS. The registrant must pay all required fees specific to the Organization type subject to the M-RETS [Terms of Use](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MRETS-Terms-of-Use-RNG-AND-REC-Effective-January-1-2020.pdf). An Organization in M-RETS will remain active until Inactivated (See Section 3.2: Inactivating an Organization).

M-RETS will check all Organization registration or modified existing Organization entries for completeness. An error message will flag mandatory fields not completed by the registrant.

Each Organization shall pay an Annual Subscription Fee. A renewal fee will be due in the month of registration of each subsequent calendar year. The Subscription Fee will be based upon the type of Organization subscribed. Below is a visual representation of the subscription types with more detailed information. Please note that for billing purposes M-RETS will use the prices listed on the website.

If a subscriber fails to pay their annual Subscription Fee within ninety (90) days of issuance, M-RETS shall close the Organization's access to the System. A User that wishes to reactivate an Inactive Organization due to failure to pay shall be required to pay the full annual Subscription Fee as well as an additional reactivation fee equal to 65% of the current Subscription Fee applicable to the closed Organization.

<ul>
  <li>Generator Registration Fee: $1,500/one-time fee (M-RETS may waive this fee if and only if the Generator meets certain conditions)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>M-RETS requires every Generator to pay a $1,500 one-time registration fee. This fee accounts for the cost of verifying the registration information prior to certificate issuance. However, Generators that register and use an Independent Reporting Entity for the full first year of generation information may have this fee waived if the Independent Reporting Entity verifies through a signed legal attestation that all the information submitted through the registration process is true and correct.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Generator Only: No Annual Subscription Fee</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This Type of Organization can register one or more renewable thermal Generators and have certificates issued to it for its Generators. A Generator Only Account can hold, make outgoing transfers, and withdraw certificates only if they are to be used in another regulatory scheme such as the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard, United States Environmental Protection Agency Renewable Fuel Standard.[[1]](#_ftn1) While Generator Only Accounts do not have annual fees, there may be fees associated with withdrawing certificates.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>General Subscription: $2,200/year</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This type of Organization can hold, transfer (outgoing and incoming), retire, and withdraw Certificates as well as register and maintain Generators and have Certificates issued to it for its Generators. This Organization type is the only type that can retire Certificates for compliance with any State or Provincial Compliance programs that utilize MRETS.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Independent Reporting Entity (IRE): No Fee</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Independent Reporting Entity is the control area operator, interconnecting utility, scheduling coordinator, or an independent third-party meter reader and is not affiliated with the owner of the Generator for which the entity is reporting; or the control area operator or interconnecting utility and that is affiliated with the Generator owner, but having sufficient segregation of duties such that the person performing the IRE duties does not have access to transfer or retire Certificates created for that Generator. An IRE must enter into an agreement with M-RETS describing the terms and conditions under which the IRE agrees to conduct business with M-RETS and must report data in accordance with the standards set forth in these Operating Procedures.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Program Administrator/Government Regulator: No Fee</li>
  <ul>
    <li>State regulators, including but not limited to public utility commission and public service commission staff and voluntary market program administrators (e.g., Green-e) may be granted a Program Administrator/Government Regulator Organization. To find out if an Organization qualifies please contact M-RETS at <systemadmin@mrets.org>.</li>

## Section 3.2: Inactivating an Organization

A User with the appropriate permissions may begin the Organization Inactivation procedure by notifying M-RETS (systemadmin@mrets.org) in writing from the email associated with a User that has the requisite permission. Â The User shall furnish the data that M-RETS should place the Organization into Inactive status. Any Generator assigned to the Organization will become Inactive and may not produce any further RTCs. Moreover, any Active RTCs will be inaccessible at the time the Organization becomes Inactive.

[[1]](#_ftnref1) It is up to the appropriate regulatory bodies such as the California Air Resources Board or the United States Environmental Protection Agency whether they will allow a generator to withdraw credits from M-RETS to use in their respective programs. M-RETS makes no guarantees that this will be allowed or that the program will not change their rules in-between when certificates were uploaded and when they are withdrawn.
