### Section 4.5.4: Voluntary Retirement Types

#### Beneficial Ownership (BBO)

<ul>
  <li>Formal Definition: With respect to any Certificate, Beneficial Ownership Rights means any contractual or other right to direct or control the sale or other disposition of, or the Retirement of, such Certificate or (ii) any contractual or other right to receive the benefits of such Certificate or any proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such Certificate.</li>
  <li>M-RETS Uses: All retirements for the benefit of an individual owner for a general environmental reason (i.e. company purchasing RTCs to green their thermal operations). Within this Retirement type there are additional options in the "Reason" drop down box. One of the reasons is utility retirement on behalf of all customers. This Reason should be selected when a utility is looking to make a voluntary retirement that can be applied to all customers.</li>
  <li>An Additional Details field is provided to allow the User to provide specific information about the sale (i.e. customer name, retirement year) Note: Compliance or Green-e Voluntary programs should not use the Beneficial Ownership retirement type. All state compliance retirements should use the Compliance Retirement Type. Green-e Voluntary Retirements should use the Green-e Thermal Certified Voluntary Market Sale Retirement Type.</li>
  </ul>

#### Green-e Thermal Certified Voluntary Market Sale (GRN)/Green-e Gas Program

<ul>
  <li>M-RETS Uses: All Green-e Retirements. To retire Certificates to substantiate sales made in a given calendar year as "Green-e Energy certified", the party retiring Certificates must have a contract in place with Center for Resource Solutions to make Green-e Thermal certified sales in that year of sale.</li>
  </ul>

#### Corporate Renewable Claim

<ul>
  <li>M-RETS Uses: Corporations that want to make claims may use this retirement time. While similar to Beneficial Ownership, it is more explicit regarding the type of claim made by the holder of the certificate. This claim should only be used when the Organization retiring Certificates is the same Organization making use of the claim. If the claim is intended for a different party, the correct selection would be Beneficial Ownership while including the name and other relevant information in the notes.</li>
  </ul>

#### Green Gas Program

<ul>
  <li>M-RETS Uses: Utility Green Gas and/or Utility Renewable Natural Gas Programs. Note: "Green-e Energy Certified" Utility Green Pricing Program Retirements should use the Green-e Energy Certified Voluntary Market Sale Retirement Reason.Â </li>
  </ul>
