### Section 4.3.9: Generator Termination

If M-RETS has cause to permanently terminate the Generating Utility's participation in M-RETS, M-RETS will cease any further production of Certificates, and the Generator will be inaccessible. Termination of a Generator does not affect Certificates previously issued in accordance with the M-RETS Terms of Use and Operating Procedures.   

If the Generator Owner wants to remove a generating unit from M-RETS, they shall notify the [M-RETS System Administrator via email](mailto:systemadmin@mrets.org) from an email account registered in that Organization with Manage Project privileges with the following information:

<ul>
  <li>The date the generating unit should be/will be removed from the M-RETS tracking system; This is the same as the final date of generation for which certificates are to be issued, and</li>
  <li>The name of the Reporting Entity, and</li>
  <li>Provide M-RETS with notice whether the Generator is moving to another tracking system and allow M-RETS to release any relevant information about the generator to the tracking System Administrator.</li>
  </ul>

M-RETS will issue Certificates for any generation that occurs prior to the date of generating unit termination as instructed by the Generator Owner. Because of the lag time between generation and Certificate issuance, this may mean that Certificates will be issued and deposited after the termination date, but only for generation that occurred prior to the termination date. Certificates will be issued for generation that occurred prior to the termination date, but whose meter reading came in within 62 days after the termination date. M-RETS will not issue Certificates for generation that occurs after the termination date.
