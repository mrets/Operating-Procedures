### Section 4.4.3: Initial Reporting and Reporting Historic Generation Upon Generator Approval

Upon registration and subsequent approval, Generators have 90-days from the Generator Approval date to upload historic generation into the M-RETS System. M-RETS will allow generation within the first 90 days of a generator's approval up to 11 years from the year of registration. If a generator registers in January 2020, M-RETS will accept generation submitted within 90 days of approval going back to the year 2009. Any generation uploaded past the 90th day from registration or more than 11 years back requires a Variance Request and if there is a program eligibility may require sign-off from the appropriate regulator.Â
