## Section 4.7: Programs

The Program feature helps regulators, regulated entities, and organizations with their internal programs to manage the complexity of various programs more efficiently. The Program feature allows regulators as well as Organizations the opportunity to set up rulesets that prevent retirements of Certificates outside the parameters set to a specified Retirement Account. 

Users may create rules around any subset or all the following attribute areas, however, the System does not require a ruleset to utilize this feature nor is this feature restricted to compliance programs:

<ol>
  <li>Vintage Start [requires Certificate vintage to be within a certain date]</li>
  <li>Vintage End [requires Certificate vintage to be within a certain date]</li>
  <li>Eligibilities [requires Certificates to have AT LEAST one of the selected eligibilities]</li>
  <li>Generator Location [Generator must originate in one of the selected state/provinces]</li>
  <li>Feedstock [Certificates must meet AT LEAST one feedstock type]</li>
  <li>Resource Types [Certificates must meet AT LEAST one resource type]</li>
  <li>Generators [Certificates must come from AT LEAST one of the selected Generators]</li>
  </ol>

### Section 4.7.1: Establishing a Program

Users can create a Program for internal use or can invite other M-RETS Organizations to participate.

Any User within a General Account Subscription Organization that has 'Manage' Program permissions can create an Internal Program. Only Organizations that create Internal Programs can use and view the Program. Any Account created as part of the Internal Program will be subject to the associated Program Ruleset.

Any User within a General Account Subscription Organization that has 'Manage' Program permissions or a Program Administrator can create an External Program. The Administrator of an External Program can invite an unlimited number of other M-RETS Organizations to participate in a Program. All participants will receive a notification inviting them to participate in the Program. Prior to becoming active Program participants, the invitee must accept the invitation.

### Section 4.7.2: Participating in a Program

Once an Organization accepts an invitation to participate in a Program, the accepting Organization must create a new Retirement Account and link the Account to the Program. As Certificates are retired into this Account, they will automatically appear on both the Program Administrator and the participant's Program dashboard. This dashboard is tailored to only show relevant information for their Program.

If a User attempts to retire Certificates that do not match the predetermined criteria of the Program, the System blocks the retirement. This prevents the retirement of incorrect Certificates.
