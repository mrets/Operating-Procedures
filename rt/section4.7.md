## Section 4.7: Programs

The Program feature helps regulators, regulated entities, and organizations with their internal programs to manage the complexity of various programs more efficiently. The Program feature allows regulators as well as Organizations the opportunity to set up rulesets that prevent retirements of Certificates outside the parameters set to a specified Retirement Account.Â 

Users may create rules around any subset or all the following attribute areas, however, the System does not require a ruleset to utilize this feature nor is this feature restricted to compliance programs:

<ol>
  <li>Vintage Start [requires Certificate vintage to be within a certain date]</li>
  <li>Vintage End [requires Certificate vintage to be within a certain date]</li>
  <li>Eligibilities [requires Certificates to have AT LEAST one of the selected eligibilities]</li>
  <li>Generator Location [Generator must originate in one of the selected state/provinces]</li>
  <li>Feedstock [Certificates must meet AT LEAST one feedstock type]</li>
  <li>Resource Types [Certificates must meet AT LEAST one resource type]</li>
  <li>Generators [Certificates must come from AT LEAST one of the selected Generators]</li>
  </ol>
