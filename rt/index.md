# Midwest Renewable Thermal Tracking System Operating Procedures

Effective 1/1/2020

# Section 1: Introduction

This document serves as a comprehensive introduction to the Midwest Renewable Energy Tracking System (M-RETS).  M-RETS staff organized this document to help lead Users through registration and use of the System.

M-RETS offers a comprehensive list of training documentation through the web application. Users can find detailed walkthroughs of features here: <https://help.mrets.org/>. M-RETS also offers custom web-based training modules for Organizations. To request training, please contact <systemadmin@mrets.org>.

M-RETS staff was all involved with the creation and editing of these Operating Procedures. At the time of creation, M-RETS staff consisted of:

Benjamin Gerber, President & Chief Executive Officer

Tanya Gajewska, Chief Administrative Officer

Rosie Hoyem, Program Manager

Sean Darling, Technical Program Coordinator

Alex Aspell, Developer

Jackie Baldwin, Software Engineering Manager

## Section 1.1: What is an RTC?
A Renewable Thermal Certificate (“RTC”) is a unique representation of the Environmental Attributes associated with the production and use of one dekatherm (“Dth”) of renewable thermal energy.  Below is a depiction of what an RTC looks like in the M-RETS RTC system. 

[Figure 1: Anatomy of an RTC]

Figures 2-4 represent the general pathway for the different currently recognized RTC pathways: Common carrier pipeline-injected RNG, Behind-the-Meter Renewable Thermal Fuel, Combined Heat and Power Using Renewable Thermal Fuels. Figure 4 would also serve to acknowledge the other methods M-RETS recognizes that utilize a more straightforward pathway such as solar thermal, geothermal, air source, ground, and water source thermal pumps, etc. If M-RETS does not list a recognized renewable thermal process, please contact the M-RETS System Administrator (systemadmin@mrets.org) to learn more and suggest an addition.

# Section 2: Privacy and Security


Except where explicitly granted within the Operating Procedures, [Terms of Use](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MRETS-Terms-of-Use-RNG-AND-REC-Effective-January-1-2020.pdf), or by Separate Agreement, M-RETS holds all User information strictly confidential. However, M-RETS provides public reports that include aggregate data available through the public area of the M-RETS website. M-RETS will not disclose any information unless provided comprehensive verification, except if the requesting party is identified as a State or Provincial Regulator. You can find more information about confidentiality in the M-RETS [Terms of Use, Section 11](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MRETS-Terms-of-Use-RNG-AND-REC-Effective-January-1-2020.pdf).

M-RETS requires Users to create a secure password with a minimum of 12 characters. M-RETS expressly prohibits the sharing of User credentials. M-RETS requires every person that logs into the System to have their separate User login credentials. M-RETS tracks the specific activities of each User through the unique User ID and password. Failure to adhere to these security recommendations and the [Terms of Use](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MRETS-Terms-of-Use-RNG-AND-REC-Effective-January-1-2020.pdf) can lead to loss of access to M-RETS.

M-RETS supports---and strongly encourages---the use of multi-factor authentication ("MFA").[[1]](#_ftn1) MFA is an opt-in process for Organizations for the time being. Our implementation will support receiving the MFA key via SMS, authenticator app, or phone call. Our goal is to make it as flexible as possible, however, to maintain the security of M-RETS and our users we reserve the right to require all users to adopt MFA. If you have any concerns or thoughts you would like to share, please contact <systemadmin@mrets.org>.

* * * * *

[[1]](#_ftnref1) The U.S. Commerce Department National Institute of Standards and Technology ("NIST") defines MFA as," Authentication using two or more factors to achieve authentication. Factors include: (i) something you know (e.g. password/personal identification number (PIN)); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). *See* NIST Computer Security Resource Center,<https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Multi_Factor_Authentication> (last accessed June 2, 2021).

# Section 3: Establishing an M-RETS Organization

Participation in M-RETS is voluntary, though some states or provinces may require participation in M-RETS for purposes of regulatory program compliance. Any party that registers with M-RETS and pays the applicable fees may establish an Organization in the System. There is no limit to the number of separate Organizations a company or individual may establish. Registrants will provide necessary Organization registration information, such as username, address, contact info, etc. to M-RETS through a secure webpage on M-RETS. The registrant must pay all required fees specific to the Organization type subject to the M-RETS [Terms of Use](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MRETS-Terms-of-Use-RNG-AND-REC-Effective-January-1-2020.pdf). An Organization in M-RETS will remain active until Inactivated (See Section 3.2: Inactivating an Organization).

M-RETS will check all Organization registration or modified existing Organization entries for completeness. An error message will flag mandatory fields not completed by the registrant.

Each Organization shall pay an Annual Subscription Fee. A renewal fee will be due in the month of registration of each subsequent calendar year. The Subscription Fee will be based upon the type of Organization subscribed. Below is a visual representation of the subscription types with more detailed information. Please note that for billing purposes M-RETS will use the prices listed on the website.

If a subscriber fails to pay their annual Subscription Fee within ninety (90) days of issuance, M-RETS shall close the Organization's access to the System. A User that wishes to reactivate an Inactive Organization due to failure to pay shall be required to pay the full annual Subscription Fee as well as an additional reactivation fee equal to 65% of the current Subscription Fee applicable to the closed Organization.

- **Generator Registration Fee: $1,500/one-time fee** (M-RETS may waive this fee if and only if the Generator meets certain conditions)

o M-RETS requires every Generator to pay a $1,500 one-time registration fee. This fee accounts for the cost of verifying the registration information prior to certificate issuance. However, Generators that register and use an Independent Reporting Entity for the full first year of generation information may have this fee waived if the Independent Reporting Entity verifies through a signed legal attestation that all the information submitted through the registration process is true and correct.

- **Generator Only: No Annual Subscription Fee**

-- This Type of Organization can register one or more renewable thermal Generators and have certificates issued to it for its Generators. A Generator Only Account can hold, make outgoing transfers, and withdraw certificates only if they are to be used in another regulatory scheme such as the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard, United States Environmental Protection Agency Renewable Fuel Standard.[[1]](#_ftn1) While Generator Only Accounts do not have annual fees, there may be fees associated with withdrawing certificates.

- **General Subscription: $2,200/year**

o This type of Organization can hold, transfer (outgoing and incoming), retire, and withdraw Certificates as well as register and maintain Generators and have Certificates issued to it for its Generators. This Organization type is the only type that can retire Certificates for compliance with any State or Provincial Compliance programs that utilize MRETS.

- **Independent Reporting Entity (IRE): No Fee**

o Independent Reporting Entity is the control area operator, interconnecting utility, scheduling coordinator, or an independent third-party meter reader and is not affiliated with the owner of the Generator for which the entity is reporting; or the control area operator or interconnecting utility and that is affiliated with the Generator owner, but having sufficient segregation of duties such that the person performing the IRE duties does not have access to transfer or retire Certificates created for that Generator. An IRE must enter into an agreement with M-RETS describing the terms and conditions under which the IRE agrees to conduct business with M-RETS and must report data in accordance with the standards set forth in these Operating Procedures.

- **Program Administrator/Government Regulator: No Fee**

o State regulators, including but not limited to public utility commission and public service commission staff and voluntary market program administrators (e.g., Green-e) may be granted a Program Administrator/Government Regulator Organization. To find out if an Organization qualifies please contact M-RETS at <systemadmin@mrets.org>.

## Section 3.1: Billing Information


It is the Organization's responsibility to make sure billing information is up to date and correct. Users may change billing information at any time. Information on how to add or update billing contact information can be found [here](https://mrets.github.io/Help/billing_add_update_billing_info).

The Organization Information tab holds billing information where Users can access Organization invoices. Information on how to view invoices can be found [here](https://mrets.github.io/Help/billing_viewing_invoices).

## Section 3.2: Inactivating an Organization

A User with the appropriate permissions may begin the Organization Inactivation procedure by notifying M-RETS (systemadmin@mrets.org) in writing from the email associated with a User that has the requisite permission.  The User shall furnish the data that M-RETS should place the Organization into Inactive status. Any Generator assigned to the Organization will become Inactive and may not produce any further RTCs. Moreover, any Active RTCs will be inaccessible at the time the Organization becomes Inactive.

* * * * *

[[1]](#_ftnref1) It is up to the appropriate regulatory bodies such as the California Air Resources Board or the United States Environmental Protection Agency whether they will allow a generator to withdraw credits from M-RETS to use in their respective programs. M-RETS makes no guarantees that this will be allowed or that the program will not change their rules in-between when certificates were uploaded and when they are withdrawn.

# Section 4: The Tracking System

## Section 4.1: Users

Users may create additional Users within their Organization by accessing the Organization Information tab within the System.

M-RETS expressly prohibits the sharing of User credentials. M-RETS requires every person that logs into the System to have their own separate User login credentials. M-RETS tracks the specific activities of each User through the unique User ID and password.

More information about confidentiality can be found in the [M-RETS Terms of Use.](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MRETS-Terms-of-Use-RNG-AND-REC-Effective-January-1-2020.pdf)

### Section 4.1.1: User Permissions

Every User in M-RETS has customizable permissions. Users can be set as Manage, Read Only, or No Access. Only a User with Manage permissions for the Organization or M-RETS can change permissions. The abilities of each level are as follows:

- Manage: Ability to view and edit the topic

- Read Only: Ability to solely view the topic

- No Access: Inability to view or edit the topic

#### Section 4.1.1.1: Organization Permission

In M-RETS, 'Organization' refers to the Organization Information, Billing Contact Information, and User List.

#### Section 4.1.1.2: Transactions Permission

In M-RETS, 'Transactions' refers to incoming and outgoing transfers of Certificates. A User with 'Manage' permissions will be able to transfer as well as accept incoming transfers of Certificates.

#### Section 4.1.1.3: Generators Permission

In M-RETS, 'Generators' refers to Projects and Generators. A User with 'Manage' permission will be able to create new Generators, edit current Generators, and mark Generators inactive.

#### Section 4.1.1.3: Billing Permission

In M-RETS, 'Billing' refers to the invoicing System. A User with 'Manage' permissions will be able to view and save invoice details.

#### Section 4.1.1.4: API Permission

In M-RETS, 'API' refers to the application programming interface. Any User that intends to connect and use our API will need Manage permissions.

#### Section 4.1.1.5: Generation Permission

In M-RETS, 'Generation' refers to the submittal and issuance of Certificates. A User with 'Manage' permissions will be able to submit generation information for issuance.

### Section 4.1.2: Notification Settings

M-RETS allows Users to opt in to email notifications when certain changes occur to their Organization. By default, M-RETS disables email notifications. M-RETS encourages Users to enable email notifications in their settings. An informational walk-through on notification settings is on the [integrated help system.](https://mrets.github.io/Help/billing_email_notifications)

There are three notification settings:

1. Transfers

2. Issuances

3. Retirements

### Section 4.1.3: Notification Categories

#### Section 4.1.3.1: Transfers

This setting automatically emails Users upon initiation and completion of a transfer.

### Section 4.1.4: Inactivating Users

It is the Organization's responsibility to make sure the User list is current. This includes inactivating Users when they leave the company or no longer require access. This also includes adding Users to replace Users that have left the Organization. Failure to do this can lead to significant delays in accessing an Organization.

To reinstate access to M-RETS, the Organization shall be required to present specific evidence that the managing employee is no longer with the Organization and the Organization maintains no other way to reset the password (e.g., accessing the former employee's email and utilizing the password reset function). M-RETS reserves the right to set the level of specific evidence, including but not limited to affidavits from executives maintaining the circumstances surrounding the departure of the employee and failure to transfer access to another User within the Organization.

Organizations may inactivate a User at any time for any reason. M-RETS may inactivate a User for failure to adhere to the Operating Procedures or Terms of Use.

## Section 4.2: Accounts

M-RETS supports three Account types: Active Accounts, Retirement Accounts, and Withdrawn Accounts. Users can transfer Certificates to specific Accounts manually or automatically upon upload. Each Account has a unique identification number, like a banking system. Users may attach aliases to Accounts for ease of reference (e.g., by state, by product name, etc.).

### Section 4.2.1: Active Accounts

An Organization can have one or more Active Account(s). An Active Account is the holding place for all active M-RETS Certificates. M-RETS Certificates in Active Accounts are liquid and an Organization---depending on the type---may be able to transfer, retire, or export the Certificates.

If the Account has a Generating Unit(s) associated with it, the Active Account will be the first point of deposit for any M-RETS Certificates created that are associated with the Generating Unit(s) ID number.

### Section 4.2.2: Deposits to the Active Account

There are three ways that M-RETS Certificates are deposited in an Active Account.

1. The Certificates can be deposited into the Account by M-RETS based on verified generation data from a Generating Unit associated with the Active Account or through an adjustment approved by M-RETS in accordance with the Operating Procedures.

2. The Organization can transfer M-RETS Certificates into their Active Account from another of the Organization's Active Accounts.

3. The Organization can accept a transfer of Certificates from another M-RETS Organization.

### Section 4.2.3: Transfers from the Active Account

There are three ways to withdraw or remove M-RETS Certificates from an Active Account:

1. Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to another of one's own Accounts (e.g.,

retirement), or

2. Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to multiple of one's own Accounts, or

3. Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to the Active Account of another M-RETS

Organization.

### Section 4.2.4: Functionality of an Active Account

In addition to being able to deposit and withdraw M-RETS Certificates from the Active Account, Organizations may view and sort their Certificates by several Certificate fields, generate reports about their Account, create additional Active Accounts, and transfer active M-RETS Certificates between Active Accounts.

### Section 4.2.5: Retirement Accounts

There is no limit to the number of Retirement Accounts an Organization may establish. A Retirement Account is a repository for M-RETS Certificates that the Organization wants to designate as retired. An Organization may want to retire Certificates for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to demonstrating compliance with a renewable mandate, retiring Certificates on behalf of "green gas" customers, or making claims about the air quality benefits of the Certificates. M-RETS Certificates in a Retirement Account are no longer transferable to another party and serve as an electronic proof of retirement.

Retirements are effective immediately upon completion of the transaction. Once an M-RETS Certificate is retired to a Retirement Account, M-RETS prevents the transfer of those Certificates into any other Account, including another Retirement Account (i.e., if an Organization has multiple Retirement Accounts). The Retirement Account is effectively the last resting place for an M-RETS Certificate.

### Section 4.2.6: Deposits to the Retirement Account

*See* Section 4.5.3: Certificate Retirement

### Section 4.2.7: Functionality of the Retirement Account

Retirement Accounts exist to hold Certificates permanently removed from circulation. The purpose of the Retirement Account is to demonstrate that those Certificates are subject to a voluntary or compliance claim. Once an Organization completes the retirement, they cannot later change the retirement reason. This prevents the Certificate from being subject to a double claim. If, however, the Organization contacts M-RETS in writing within 24-hours from the time the Organization indicated the reason for retirement, M-RETS may grant a variance.

M-RETS will grant a variance within the 24-hour notice period when there is no likelihood a Certificate was claimed to be retired for multiple reasons and M-RETS does not suspect any nefarious intent or impropriety. If M-RETS believes there is any chance of double-counting, they shall deny the request for a variance.

If an Organization notices an error in the selected retirement reason outside the 24-hour window, the Organization may contact M-RETS (<systemadmin@mrets.org>) in writing and ask that M-RETS grant [a variance](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Variance-Request-Form-2021.docx).[[1]](#_ftn1) M-RETS shall review all request made outside of the 24-hour window and may grant a variance if they determine that the request is made in good faith and: that the Organization submitted their request for a variance in writing within a reasonable amount of time after discovering the error, that there is a legitimate reason for the change, and that there is no likelihood a Certificate was claimed to be retired for multiple reasons. M-RETS may submit the variance request---or send an email outlining the circumstances---to a state or provincial regulator should there be concern compliance with the variance request could result in potential double-counting.

M-RETS has a pull-down menu of options for acceptable retirement reasons that the Organization must select to complete the retirement. The options will be consistent with regulatory programs and any voluntary programs or voluntary market activities. Users shall notify M-RETS if they would like to add a new type of voluntary or compliance retirement reason.

### Section 4.2.8: Functionality of the Withdrawn Account

Withdrawn Accounts exist in M-RETS to hold Certificates permanently removed from circulation. Certificate Owners may only Withdraw if after upload the Certificate Owner decided to use the Certificates in a Program that does not officially recognize M-RETS. Once an Organization completes the Withdrawal, they cannot later upload the same generation information. This prevents the Certificate from being subject to double-counting. However, if the Organization contacts M-RETS in writing within 24-hours from the time the Organization indicated the reason for Withdrawal, M-RETS may grant a variance.

M-RETS may grant a variance within the 24-hour notice period when there is no likelihood a Certificate could be subject to a claim in a system or through paper attestation or other means outside M-RETS. Moreover, M-RETS will only grant a variance if the System Administrator does not suspect any nefarious intent or impropriety. If M-RETS believes there is any chance of double-counting, they shall deny the request for a variance.

If an Organization notices an error in the Withdrawal reason outside the 24-hour window, the Organization may contact M-RETS (<systemadmin@mrets.org>) in writing and ask that M-RETS grant [a variance](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Variance-Request-Form-2021.docx).[[2]](#_ftn2) M-RETS shall review all request made outside of the 24-hour window and may grant a variance if they determine that the request is made in good faith and: that the Organization submitted their request for a variance in writing within a reasonable amount of time after discovering the error, that there is a legitimate reason for the change, and that there is no likelihood a Certificate could be claimed outside of M-RETS in a way that subjects that claim to double-counting or results in inadequate or poor data quality within M-RETS (e.g., the reason for withdrawal changes as the Certificate is intended for a different system than initially notated within M-RETS). M-RETS may submit the variance request---or send an email outlining the circumstances---to a state or provincial regulator should there be concern compliance with the variance request could result in potential double-counting or M-RETS providing inaccurate data.

M-RETS has a pull-down menu of options for acceptable Withdrawal reasons that the Generator Owner must select to complete the Withdrawal. The options will be consistent with regulatory programs and any voluntary programs or voluntary market activities. Users shall notify M-RETS if they would like to add a new Withdrawal reason.

M-RETS will work with market participants to determine Withdrawal types. For example, it could be to Export the RTC to another country or system.

### Section 4.2.9: Account Status

M-RETS classifies Accounts with the following statuses: Open, Closed, Archived, and Frozen.
