# Midwest Renewable Thermal Tracking System Operating Procedures

Effective 1/1/2020

## Section 1: Introduction

This document serves as a comprehensive introduction to the Midwest Renewable Energy Tracking System (M-RETS).  M-RETS staff organized this document to help lead Users through registration and use of the System.

M-RETS offers a comprehensive list of training documentation through the web application. Users can find detailed walkthroughs of features here: <https://help.mrets.org/>. M-RETS also offers custom web-based training modules for Organizations. To request training, please contact <systemadmin@mrets.org>.

M-RETS staff was all involved with the creation and editing of these Operating Procedures. At the time of creation, M-RETS staff consisted of:

Benjamin Gerber, President & Chief Executive Officer

Tanya Gajewska, Chief Administrative Officer

Rosie Hoyem, Program Manager

Sean Darling, Technical Program Coordinator

Alex Aspell, Developer

Jackie Baldwin, Software Engineering Manager

### Section 1.1: What is an RTC?
A Renewable Thermal Certificate (“RTC”) is a unique representation of the Environmental Attributes associated with the production and use of one dekatherm (“Dth”) of renewable thermal energy.  Below is a depiction of what an RTC looks like in the M-RETS RTC system. 

[Figure 1: Anatomy of an RTC]

Figures 2-4 represent the general pathway for the different currently recognized RTC pathways: Common carrier pipeline-injected RNG, Behind-the-Meter Renewable Thermal Fuel, Combined Heat and Power Using Renewable Thermal Fuels. Figure 4 would also serve to acknowledge the other methods M-RETS recognizes that utilize a more straightforward pathway such as solar thermal, geothermal, air source, ground, and water source thermal pumps, etc. If M-RETS does not list a recognized renewable thermal process, please contact the M-RETS System Administrator (systemadmin@mrets.org) to learn more and suggest an addition.

Section 2: Privacy and Security
===============================

Except where explicitly granted within the Operating Procedures, [Terms of Use](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MRETS-Terms-of-Use-RNG-AND-REC-Effective-January-1-2020.pdf), or by Separate Agreement, M-RETS holds all User information strictly confidential. However, M-RETS provides public reports that include aggregate data available through the public area of the M-RETS website. M-RETS will not disclose any information unless provided comprehensive verification, except if the requesting party is identified as a State or Provincial Regulator. You can find more information about confidentiality in the M-RETS [Terms of Use, Section 11](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MRETS-Terms-of-Use-RNG-AND-REC-Effective-January-1-2020.pdf).

M-RETS requires Users to create a secure password with a minimum of 12 characters. M-RETS expressly prohibits the sharing of User credentials. M-RETS requires every person that logs into the System to have their separate User login credentials. M-RETS tracks the specific activities of each User through the unique User ID and password. Failure to adhere to these security recommendations and the [Terms of Use](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MRETS-Terms-of-Use-RNG-AND-REC-Effective-January-1-2020.pdf) can lead to loss of access to M-RETS.

M-RETS supports---and strongly encourages---the use of multi-factor authentication ("MFA").[[1]](#_ftn1) MFA is an opt-in process for Organizations for the time being. Our implementation will support receiving the MFA key via SMS, authenticator app, or phone call. Our goal is to make it as flexible as possible, however, to maintain the security of M-RETS and our users we reserve the right to require all users to adopt MFA. If you have any concerns or thoughts you would like to share, please contact <systemadmin@mrets.org>.

[[1]](#_ftnref1) The U.S. Commerce Department National Institute of Standards and Technology ("NIST") defines MFA as," Authentication using two or more factors to achieve authentication. Factors include: (i) something you know (e.g. password/personal identification number (PIN)); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). *See* NIST Computer Security Resource Center,<https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Multi_Factor_Authentication> (last accessed June 2, 2021).
