### Section 4.4.8: IRE Verification Scope

Certificates reported into the system by an IRE must adhere to a strict standard. Certificates uploaded into the system by an IRE will carry an IRE eligibility. That will indicate the certificates have gone through a strict independent third-party verification. Failure to adhere to the standards agreed to between M-RETS, the Generator Owner, and the IRE may result in removal of a Generator from the M-RETS system, cancellation of any certificates suspected of incorrectly maintaining an IRE eligibility, and removal of the IRE from further participation in M-RETS.

IREs must strictly adhere to the following independent third-party verification process. IRE's may adhere to a stricter process, however, in no case shall an IRE do less than required below.

|*Verification objective*|*Method*|*Frequency*|
|-------------------------|--------|----------|
|1. The carbon intensity (CI) of the RNG source is equal to or less than what is claimed initially. If more than one, each CI must be done. Generators that utilize an IRE but do not track a CI are exempt from this requirement.|1. Review all inputs and outputs that could affect CI<br> 2. Recalculate CI based on annual data <br>3. Confirm annual CI is within an acceptable range <br>4. Prepare report and upload to the M-RETS System via the Generator Documents|Annual|
|2. Reported gas volumes injected into the common carrier pipeline are accurate|1. Review EDI/meter data <br>2. Submit gas volumes injected into the M-RETS System<br>3. Review meter calibration<br>4. Compare with proof of biogas production <br>5. Verify biogas production from inputs/outputs<br>6. Confirm upgrading unit efficiency<br>7. Prepare a report of the above and upload it to M-RETS via the generation submission process.|Monthly (via attestation, and becomes attached to certificate and visible to future owners in the chain of custody)|
|3. The RNG production site is physically connected to a common carrier pipeline|Visual inspection|Annual|
|4. The Environmental Attributes are intact, and the same gas claimed in M-RETS is not sold elsewhere.|Affidavit from biogas producer and RNG producer and upload Affidavits into M-RETS via the Generator Documents Portal.|Quarterly (provided one time at the Annual Review on or after January 1)|
