### Section 4.3.4: Multi-Feedstock Generator

A multi-feedstock Generator can produce energy using more than one feedstock type, where the quantity of each of the feedstock used is greater than 1% annually on a total input basis. This is often the result of Anaerobic Co-Digestion, where one or more feedstocks are added to the Anaerobic Digestion process to increase yields. [[1]](#_ftn1) A multi-feedstock Generator can be a Generating Unit that uses a renewable feedstock with a non-renewable feedstock or one that uses multiple types of renewable feedstocks. Such facilities must register with M-RETS as a multi-feedstock Generator. A Generator that uses 1% or less of a second feedstock may elect to register as a single feedstock Generator if they would like Certificates issued for the second feedstock type. If the Generator Owner or M-RETS cannot measure or calculate the relative quantities of renewable energy production from each feedstock, the generator is not eligible to register as a multi-feedstock Generating Unit in M-RETS.

M-RETS only creates Certificates for energy produced from a renewable feedstock. Each Certificate issued for a Multi-Feedstock Generating Unit will reflect only one Feedstock and Resource Type. The total number of Certificates issued for a Feedstock in a reporting period will be proportional to the output from that Feedstock for that reporting period.

The Generator or its user must maintain supporting documentation related to the derivation of the proportion of energy output per Feedstock for each Reporting Period, at the generation facility for a minimum of two years from the date of submission to M-RETS. M-RETS may require copies of such calculations and supporting documentation will be subject to audit by M-RETS, state regulators, or their agents. M-RETS shall treat as Confidential Information all data submitted to or audited by M-RETS subject to the requirements of this paragraph not contained in reports available to the public.

#### Section 4.3.4.1: Allocating Output for Each Feedstock

Upon registration, all multi-feedstock generators must submit to M-RETS a report prepared by a licensed professional engineer containing documentation for measuring and verifying the quantities of each Feedstock. M-RETS will share this documentation with state or provincial regulators upon request of the regulator.

For purposes of creating M-RETS Certificates reflecting the Feedstock mix of multi-feedstock Generating Units, the proportion of Certificates attributable to each Feedstock shall be determined consistent with reports provided by the licensed professional engineer. M-RETS reserves the right to require any Multi-Feedstock Generator to use an IRE.
