# Appendix B: Glossary

**Account**: M-RETS provides several different Accounts for holding and retiring M-RETS Certificates

**Active Account**: The Active Account is the holding place for all active M-RETS Certificates.   If the Organization is a registered generator, or is the designated representative of a registered generator, their Active Account will be the first point of deposit for any M-RETS Certificates created that are associated with the Generating Unit ID number, unless the Certificate is subject to an automatic recurring transfer.  An Active Account may be associated with one or more Generating Units.

**Retirement Account**: A Retirement Account is used as a repository for M-RETS Certificates that the Organization wants to designate as retired and remove from circulation. Once a Certificate has been transferred into an M-RETS Retirement Account, it cannot be transferred again to any other Account.

**Active Account**: See Account 

**Active Certificates**: Any Certificate held in an M-RETS Active Account. The holder of the Active Account or their agent may trade, transfer, export, or retire, etc. certificates at their discretion. 

**Agent**: Any party granted access by an M-RETS Organization to “use” their Organization. Agents may include viewing information, performing transactions, changing personal information, etc. The Organization may at any time revoke the permissions granted to an Agent by notifying M-RETS. The M-RETS System will be able to track the specific activities of each Agent through the unique user ID and password. Also known as a User.

**Anaerobic Digestion**: The degradation of organic matter including manure brought about through the action of microorganisms in the absence of elemental oxygen. The decomposition process produces a gaseous byproduct called “biogas” primarily composed of methane and carbon dioxide.   

**Automatic Recurring Transfers**:	Normally, the first point of deposit for M-RETS Certificates is the Account to which a Generating Unit selects as its issuance Account. With an Automatic Recurring Transfer, the Organization to which the Generating Unit is registered requests that the Certificates be directly deposited into another Account when the Certificates are created. Automatic Recurring Transfers may be set up for transfers to:
1.	One internal Account
2.	Multiple internal Accounts
3.	An external Organization within M-RETS
4.	A Compatible Certificate Tracking System (Export)
Automatic Recurring Transfers can be set as Irrevocable during the confirmation of the transfer process. However, only M-RETS can edit Irrevocable Automatic Recurring Transfers once they are set. 

**Behind-the-Meter**: See Non-Pipeline Connected. 

**British Thermal Unit (Btu)**: The quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. 1,000,000 Btu equals 1 Dth. 

**Biogas**: The gas resulting from the anaerobic digestion of biomass. Depending upon the feedstocks used and conditions of digestion, biogas typically consists of 40 – 65% methane. The remaining 35 – 60% of the biogas consists of “other” gases, with carbon dioxide being the major other gas along with trace gases including nitrogen compounds (ammonia, etc.), water vapor, sulfur compounds (hydrogen sulfide, etc.), and other constituents, depending upon the biomass used. Biogas is considered “raw” unless “conditioned” or “upgraded” to meet the requirements of the intended end-use, including pipeline injection. “Raw” biogas is not interchangeable with natural gas pipeline networks. Biogas is produced in processes including, but not limited to, anaerobic digestion, anaerobic decomposition, and thermochemical decomposition. These processes are applied to biodegradable biomass materials, such as manure, sewage, municipal solid waste, green waste, and waste from energy crops, to produce landfill gas, digester gas, and other forms of biogas. 

**Biomass**: Organic materials that may be converted to gaseous or liquid fuel through digestion (breakdown) or high-temperature conversion (gasification). These materials may include all organic substances, but some biomass materials have higher energy potential than others, and some are more suited for anaerobic digestion while others with high lignin content are more suitable for gasification. Biomass sources vary widely and include domestic wastes, animal wastes, livestock operation residues, forest and mill residues, agricultural crops and wastes, wood and wood wastes, aquatic plants, fast‐growing trees and plants, and municipal and industrial wastes. 

**Biomethane**: Another term for RNG. 

**Carbon Intensity**: Carbon intensity is expressed in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy provided by that fuel. RTCs also show the value in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per Dth. The conversion factor used for this value is 105.5 (MJ/Therm) comes from the California Air Resources Board Unofficial Electronic Version with an effective of date July 1, 2020 page 70 Table 4.

**Carbon Pathway**: A detailed description of all stages of thermal resource production and use, including feedstock generation, production, cleaning or conditioning, transportation, distribution, and combustion or final disposition and use of the renewable resource by the consumer. The fuel pathway—either a Full Lifecycle or Partial Lifecycle Carbon Pathway is used to calculate the carbon intensity of each source. See Full Lifecycle Carbon Pathway or Partial Carbon Pathway.

**Certificate**: The term “Certificate,” as used in this document, refers to an M-RETS Certificate of generation, or M-RETS Certificate. An M-RETS Certificate represents all the attributes from one Dth of energy from a renewable Generating Unit registered with the M-RETS tracking system. M-RETS creates one Certificate per Dth of generation produced by a registered Generating Unit. In the case of Renewable Natural Gas, Certificates are created upon injection of the gas into the common carrier network (i.e. interstate natural gas pipeline system) or a local gas distribution company network. M-RETS will consider “behind-the-meter” uses such as onsite biogas combustion used for thermal purposes or onsite thermal use (e.g., combined heat and power) See also the definition of “Whole Certificate.”

**CH4**: Methane

**CO2e**: Carbon dioxide equivalent. CO2 is the benchmark greenhouse gas with a “global warming potential” (GWP) of 1. The GWP of other greenhouse gases is measured in relation to CO2; e.g., methane has a GWP 28 times greater than CO2 (100-year timeline), so that a ton of methane has a “CO2e” value of 28.

**Common Carrier**: Common carrier refers to any pipeline that offers transportation services to any third party under a standard set of terms. This is in contrast to a private or proprietary pipeline that is either used by the owner for internal purposes or contracted to only a limited set of users.

**Creation Date**: The date that M-RETS Certificates are created. Certificates are created monthly, seven days after the Organization has accepted the generation amount of the Generation Activity Log.

**Customer-Sited Distributed Generation**: Generation interconnected behind a retail customer meter and therefore not directly interconnected with either the distribution system or transmission system (including net metered facilities). 

**Date of First Operation**: The month and year a Generating Unit first began commercial operation or for non-commercial facilities, the date approved by the licensing or permitting agency. For repowered or refurbished Generating Units, this is the date of the original operation, not the date of the repower or refurbishing. For incremental capacity, this is the date of the original operation for the non-incremental capacity. M-RETS may refine the definition of Date of First Operation for small non-commercial Generating Units in the future.

**Digester (Anaerobic)**: A tank, covered lagoon, or another covered vessel designed to convert biomass to biogas. Digesters are common to the wastewater treatment industry as well as in farming operations for manure management. Conversion of the biomass in the digester depends upon bacterial degradation or transformation of compounds, both carbon‐based and other, to gaseous products, which are then present in the resulting biogas. Digesters vary in complexity and design. The maximum quantity of biogas generated from the digestion of biomass is dependent upon the design of the digester (temperature and hydraulic retention time), a biologically degradable fraction of the raw material, and other factors. Biogas generated through anaerobic digestion of biomass in digesters requires further cleanup prior to use (interchange) within natural gas pipeline systems. 

**Dispute Resolution Process**: Administrative process managed by M-RETS to resolve disputes regarding M-RETS functionality and actions, including but not limited to disputes related to the number of Certificates in an Account, static data, Organization requests to reverse permanent transactions (such as retirements), and Certificate creation.

**Dekatherm (“Dth”)**: Ten therms or 1,000,000 Btu. This is the default unit of measurement in the M-RETS Renewable Thermal Tracking System. 

**Dynamic Data**: Dynamic data is variable information that is associated with a specific Dth from a registered Generating Unit, such as Certificate serial number or date of generation. See Appendix B-1 for a list of dynamic data fields.

**Environmental Attribute(s)**: Any and all environmental claims, credits, benefits, emissions reductions, offsets, and allowances attributable to the production of renewable thermal energy (e.g., RNG) and if applicable its avoided emission of pollutants. The environmental attributes of renewable natural gas include but are not limited to the avoided greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production, transport, and combustion of a quantity of renewable natural gas compared with the same quantity of geologic natural gas. Environmental attributes do not include: 
<ol>
  <li>The renewable natural gas itself or the energy content of that gas; </li>
  <li>Any tax credits associated with the construction or operation of the renewable natural gas production facility or other financial incentives in the form of credits, deductions, or allowances associated with the production of renewable natural gas that applies to a state, provincial, or federal income tax obligation;</li>
  <li>Fuel- or feedstock-related subsidies or “tipping fees” that may be paid to the seller to accept certain fuels, or local subsidies received by the renewable natural gas production facility for the destruction of particular preexisting pollutants or the promotion of local environmental benefits; or</li>
  <li>Emission reduction credits encumbered or used by the renewable natural gas production facility for compliance with local, state, provincial, or federal operating and/or air quality permits.</li>
  </ol>

**Environmental Attribute(s) (California Low Carbon Fuel Standard)**: A greenhouse gas emission reduction recognition in any form, including verified emission reductions, voluntary emission reductions, offsets, allowances, credits, avoided compliance costs, emission rights, and authorizations under any law or regulation, or any emission reduction registry, trading system, or reporting or reduction program for greenhouse gas emissions that is established, certified, maintained, or recognized by any international, governmental, or non-governmental agency. If there is any difference between the definition listed herein and the most recent official regulations maintained on the California Air Resources Board (https://ww2.arb.ca.gov) then the official regulations shall take precedence. 

**Facility/Generating Facility**: See Generator.

**Feedstock**: Raw material that for the purposes of M-RETS is considered renewable and that is transformed through chemical, physical, or any other process into a renewable Resource Type.  

**Full Lifecycle Carbon Pathway** - Takes into account the GHG emissions associated with all of the steps of producing, transporting, and consuming a fuel. 
Gas Cleanup and Gas Upgrading: Used somewhat interchangeably in reference to the unit operations for treating raw gas resulting from biomass conversion. The goal of the gas cleanup unit is to remove constituents within the raw gas that could cause pipeline or end‐user health or safety issues. Cleanup efficiencies for constituents of concern vary between cleanup or “conditioning” units. An upgrading unit for biogas will isolate the methane from the carbon dioxide in order to increase the heating value of the RNG, while an upgrading unit for syngas will reform the hydrogen and carbon monoxide to form methane in order to produce RNG. 

**Gasification**: An alternate way to produce a raw gas which can be used to produce RNG. Gasification is a high‐temperature, low oxygen conversion process of organic material into a syngas that can be reformed into methane and cleaned of trace constituents into RNG for pipeline injection. 

**Gasifier/Syngas**: See Gasification

**Generating Unit**: Equipment or machinery that converts Feedstock into a Resource Type. 

**Generation Activity Log**: The Generation Activity Log is an electronic ledger where generation is posted prior to Certificate creation. Each time generation data is received by M-RETS for a Generating Unit, the date and quantity of Dths is posted to the Generation Activity Log. Similarly, adjustments received will be posted likewise.

**Generation Document**: An injection receipt, injection invoice, meter readout, or another similar document that provides the same level of assurance that gas was received into a common carrier pipeline, a private pipeline, a local distribution utility, or was produced and used in a behind the meter application. M-RETS shall reject documentation if it does not provide adequate assurance to parties. 

**Generation Month**: The generation month is the calendar month in which the generation occurred.

**Generator**: An electric generating facility consisting of one or more Generating Units with the same essential generation characteristics and whose output is measured with a single certified meter. 

**Generator Registration Agreement**: The agreement between an Organization and M-RETS which sets forth terms and conditions for use of the M-RETS System.

**Geothermal**: Hot water or steam extracted from geothermal reservoirs in the Earth's crust. Water or steam extracted from geothermal reservoirs can be used for geothermal heat pumps or water heating. 

**Heat Pump:** 
**Heat pump (geothermal)**:  A heat pump in which the refrigerant exchanges heat (in a heat exchanger) with a fluid circulating through an earth connection medium (ground or groundwater). The fluid is contained in a variety of loop (pipe) configurations depending on the temperature of the ground and the ground area available. Loops may be installed horizontally or vertically in the ground or submerged in a body of water. 

**Water source heat pump**:  A type of (geothermal) heat pump that uses well (ground) or surface water as a heat source. Water has a more stable seasonal temperature than air thus making for a more efficient heat source.

**Heating Value**: Gross heating value, also known as Higher Heating Value (HHV), is defined as the amount of energy transferred as heat from the complete, ideal combustion of the gas with air, at a standard temperature, in which all the water formed by the reaction condenses to liquid. Another commonly seen heating value parameter is net heating value, or Lower Heating Value (LHV). The difference between HHV and LHV is that the water produced by combustion remains in the vapor state when determining the LHV. The energy gained by the condensation of the water vapor is not realized so the heating value is lower. Heating values are also often reported as wet or dry. Wet gas refers to gas that is completely saturated with water vapor. A wet gas has a lower heating value per volume than a dry gas because some of the gas volume is occupied by the water vapor, so the absolute amount of combustible gas is less. The North American Energy Standards Board recommends utilizing the HHV expressed on a dry basis. 

**Incremental Capacity**: Nameplate capacity added to an existing generator. Incremental Capacity may consist of one or more new Generating Units. Incremental capacity does not include repowered capacity

**Independent Reporting Entity**: A Reporting Entity that is (1) an independent third-party meter reader not affiliated with the owner of the generator for which the entity is reporting; or (2) the interconnecting utility and that is affiliated with the generator owner, but having sufficient segregation of duties such that the person performing the Independent Reporting Entity duties does not have access to transfer or retire Certificates created for that generator. The Independent Reporting Entity must report data in accordance with the standards set forth in these Operating Procedures and in the M-RETS Terms of Use.

**Interface Control Document**: An Interface Control Document contains the protocol for collecting and transferring generation data from participating control areas and other reporting entities to M-RETS for the purposes of creating M-RETS Certificates. The Interface Control Document will identify M-RETS Registered Generators to be reported for that interface, as well as the collection of information such as meter IDs, data format, communication protocols, timing, and security requirements for data collection.

**Interchangeability**: The ability to substitute one gas for another (in the context of natural gas replacement) without materially changing or influencing environmental health and safety, end-use performance, or pipeline integrity. 

**Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline**: Any pipeline located in the United State of America under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) jurisdiction subject to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

**Landfill Gas**: Gas which is emitted from the breakdown of materials in a landfill. This gas is considered “raw” and requires upgrading for introduction to the pipeline network. 

**Local Distribution Company (“LDC”)**: Any firm, other than a natural gas pipeline, engaged in the transportation or local distribution of natural gas and its sale to customers that will consume the gas. 

**Methane**:  A colorless, odorless, flammable hydrocarbon gas that is the main component of natural gas.

**M-RETS Certificates**: See Certificate. 

**Marketer**: A marketer is any person that either purchases RTCs for sale to others or a broker that arranges sales of RTCs between two or more parties.

**Month and Year of Generation**: See Vintage.

**Multi-Feedstock Indicator**: An indication that the Generating Unit or generator can use more than one Feedstock type to generate a Resource Type capable of production RTCs. This often occurs as co-digestion, when feedstocks are mixed in the Anaerobic Digestion process to increase output. The multi-feedstock indicator will be selected during registration or later if the Generating Unit or Generator is converted to multi-feedstock capability after registration is complete. 

**Nameplate Capacity/Maximum Generator Nameplate Capacity**: The maximum rated output of a generator per month and year. 

**Natural Gas**: A naturally occurring combustible mixture of gases recovered from the earth from wells. It is composed predominantly of methane but contains other light hydrocarbons and impurities. 

**Non-Qualified Generation**: Generation that does not qualify for M-RETS Renewable Thermal Certificate creation. This includes RNG recorded as part of an injection but sold into a program that does not recognize and/or utilize M-RETS as well as non-renewable additives added to RNG.

**Non-Pipeline Connected**: A Generator that does not carry the Pipeline Connected attribute. This attribute means the generator may be a private or proprietary pipeline that is either used by the owner for internal purposes or contracted to only a limited set of users or the Generator does not meet requirements to qualify as Pipeline Connected. An example is a closed-loop CHP system. 

**Organization**: An M-RETS Organization is a party that has registered with M-RETS and has established an Organization within the M-RETS system. Also referred to as a Subscriber or User. 

**Partial Carbon Pathway**: Takes into account the GHG emissions associated with all of the steps of producing a fuel up to the Injection Point or interconnection into the distribution system or interstate transportation system. Expressed as a Carbon Intensity. Some programs may allow a Partial Carbon Pathway to represent the CI of the fuel from the Injection Point to the source. Make sure to check the documentation and the start point and endpoint of the CI. 

**Pipeline Operator**: For purposes of this document, the pipeline operator owns and operates the pipeline system. The pipeline operator may be a Local Distribution Company (LDC) or utility, or it may be a pipeline transmission company that sells gas to the LDC. 

**Pipeline Connected**: For purposes of an RTC, pipeline connected means that the Generator is not “behind-the-meter” and therefore is connected to any legally recognized transportation system, including, but not limited to any: major interstate pipeline, intrastate pipeline, pipeline distribution, pipeline transmission, and/or Hinshaw pipeline. This includes without question common carrier systems legally recognized by any local, state, federal, or provincial regulator, statute, or ruling. This does not include a private or proprietary pipeline that is either used by the owner for internal purposes or contracted to only a limited set of users. 

**Pipeline Quality**: Meets the requirements for injection into a common carrier system. 

**Qualified Generation**: Renewable Thermal Generation Information that meets the strict data and reporting requirements for M-RETS Certificate creation. Only Qualified Generation can be issued M-RETS RTCs. 

**Registered Generator**: A renewable energy source, known as a Generating Facility or Generator, that has registered with M-RETS.

**Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)**: Generally, a Renewable Portfolio Standard is a legislative or administrative requirement on a gas utility or load-serving entities in a jurisdiction to include a designated percentage of renewable thermal energy to their load. 

**Renewable Natural Gas or RNG or Biomethane**: Pipeline quality injectable gaseous fuel derived from biomass or other renewable sources that have lower lifecycle CO2e emissions than geological natural gas. It is the portion of biogas that consists primarily of methane. RNG is generally extracted from raw biogas through cleanup or conditioning, to remove those constituents which impact gas quality. Using effective biogas cleanup (removal of gases that affect overall gas quality). RNG is considered suitable for many end‐use applications and may be considered suitable for inclusion in common carrier pipeline systems, depending upon other characteristics of the gas and specific tariff requirements. 

Unless a state, provincial, or federal statute dictates otherwise, to be recognized as renewable natural gas, the methane must either be: (1) produced from the anaerobic decomposition of organic material, including co-digestion; or, (2) The methane is produced from the non-combustion thermal conversion of any of the following materials when separated from other waste:
<ol>
  <li>Agricultural crop residues.</li>
  <li>Bark, lawn, yard, and garden clippings.</li>
  <li>Leaves, silvicultural residue, and tree and brush prunings.</li>

  <li>Nonrecyclable pulp or nonrecyclable paper materials.</li>
  <li>Livestock waste.</li>
  <li>Municipal sewage sludge or biosolids.</li>
  </ol>

**Renewable Thermal**: Energy generated and used for no electric purposes by a facility that any state, province, or territory participating in M-RETS considers renewable by law or policy. This includes, but is not limited to: biogas, renewable natural gas (“RNG”) also known as biomethane, solar thermal, renewable gas (i.e. hydrogen produced using renewable energy), the heat produced by a combined heat and power system using recognized renewable feedstock (e.g., biomass, wood waste, etc.), ground source heating and cooling pumps, and geothermal energy.

**Renewable Thermal Certificate (RTC)**: a unique representation of the environmental attributes associated with the production, transport, and use of one dekatherm of renewable thermal energy (e.g., one Dth of RNG.

**Reporting Entities**: See Independent Reporting Entity. 

**IRE Entity Terms of Use**: The agreement between a reporting entity and M-RETS that describes the terms and conditions under which the reporting entity agrees to exchange information and conduct business with M-RETS.

**Resource Type or Thermal Resource**: The type of fuel or other naturally occurring thermal energy source produced by the associated Generating Unit. Resource Type is indicated during generator registration (e.g., a biogas generator produces biogas as a Resource Type while a renewable natural gas generator produces renewable natural gas). 

**Responsible Party**: An M-RETS Organization that has been assigned the Rights of Registration for a given Generating Unit. This gives the designated Organization full and sole management and authority over the transactions and activities related to the Generating Unit within M-RETS.

**Retirement Account**: See Account 

**Retirement of Certificates**: Retirement of Certificates is an action taken to remove a Certificate from circulation within the M-RETS system. Retirement may be initiated only by the M-RETS Organization for Certificates in their own Account(s). Retirement is effectuated by transferring Certificates into a Retirement Account.

**Self-Reporting Generator**: A generator that does not use a IRE to report generation. All certificates from Self-Reporting Generators will be indicated as self-reported.  

**Solar Thermal** – A solar energy conversion system characterized by the optical concentration of solar rays through an arrangement of mirrors to generate a high temperature working fluid

**Static Data**: Static data describes the attributes of the Generating Unit. Static information generally includes information related to the characteristics of the generation facility such as technology type, ownership, or location. See Appendix B-1 for a list of M-RETS Static Data Fields.

**Syngas**: Also known as synthesis gas, it is a fuel gas mixture consisting primarily of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and often some carbon dioxide. It is the intermediate product in the process of creating synthetic natural gas (SNG). Syngas is usually a product of gasification. 
Upgrading (of cleaned biogas): The process of removing diluents to improve the methane percentage of gas and thus the heat content and quality of the gas. 

**Vintage**: Month and Year of generation. The vintage on the issued Certificate will be the last month and year of generation contributing to an accumulated Dth. 

**Virtual Pipeline**: A system whereby, in the absence of a nearby pipeline, gas is loaded onto special container trucks and driven to an injection point along a more distant pipeline. Gas can also be delivered by this method directly to fueling stations.

**Wobbe Number**: An interchangeability parameter that takes both the higher heating value and the relative density of the gas into consideration and accounts for both heat content and gas flow through a fixed orifice. The Wobbe Number is calculated by dividing the HHV by the square root of the relative density. Differences in the relative density, and by extrapolation the Wobbe Number, generally come from the presence of other hydrocarbons or diluent and inert gases such as carbon dioxide or air (nitrogen plus oxygen). 

**Whole/ Whole Certificate**: A “Whole Certificate” is one where none of the renewable and/or environmental attributes have been separately sold, given, or otherwise transferred to another party by a deliberate act of the Certificate owner. Renewable attributes shall include the Environmental Attributes that are defined as any and all certificates, benefits, emissions reductions, offsets, and allowances, howsoever entitled, directly attributable to the generation from the Generating Unit(s). Individual states and provinces may create different definitions of renewable Certificates. M-RETS may consider revision of the definition of an M-RETS Certificate in the future if needed to better meet the needs of state and provincial programs. See also the definition of “Certificate.”

**Yield**: The amount of RNG that can be produced from each dry ton of biomass feedstock input. This unit is expressed in British Thermal Units (Btus) and Million Standard Cubic Feet (MMSCF) of natural gas equivalent.
