## Section 4.2: Accounts

M-RETS supports three Account types: Active Accounts, Retirement Accounts, and Withdrawn Accounts. Users can transfer Certificates to specific Accounts manually or automatically upon upload. Each Account has a unique identification number, like a banking system. Users may attach aliases to Accounts for ease of reference (e.g., by state, by product name, etc.).

### Section 4.2.1: Active Accounts

An Organization can have one or more Active Account(s). An Active Account is the holding place for all active M-RETS Certificates. M-RETS Certificates in Active Accounts are liquid and an Organization---depending on the type---may be able to transfer, retire, or export the Certificates.

If the Account has a Generating Unit(s) associated with it, the Active Account will be the first point of deposit for any M-RETS Certificates created that are associated with the Generating Unit(s) ID number.

### Section 4.2.2: Deposits to the Active Account

There are three ways that M-RETS Certificates are deposited in an Active Account.

<ol>
  <li>The Certificates can be deposited into the Account by M-RETS based on verified generation data from a Generating Unit associated with the Active Account or through an adjustment approved by M-RETS in accordance with the Operating Procedures.</li>
  <li>The Organization can transfer M-RETS Certificates into their Active Account from another of the Organization's Active Accounts.</li>
  <li>The Organization can accept a transfer of Certificates from another M-RETS Organization.</li>
  </ol>

### Section 4.2.3: Transfers from the Active Account

There are three ways to withdraw or remove M-RETS Certificates from an Active Account:

<ol>
  <li>Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to another of one's own Accounts (e.g. retirement), or</li>
  <li>Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to multiple of one's own Accounts, or</li>
  <li>Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to the Active Account of another M-RETS Organization.</li>
  </ol>

### Section 4.2.4: Functionality of an Active Account

In addition to being able to deposit and withdraw M-RETS Certificates from the Active Account, Organizations may view and sort their Certificates by several Certificate fields, generate reports about their Account, create additional Active Accounts, and transfer active M-RETS Certificates between Active Accounts.

### Section 4.2.5: Retirement Accounts

There is no limit to the number of Retirement Accounts an Organization may establish. A Retirement Account is a repository for M-RETS Certificates that the Organization wants to designate as retired. An Organization may want to retire Certificates for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to demonstrating compliance with a renewable mandate, retiring Certificates on behalf of "green gas" customers, or making claims about the air quality benefits of the Certificates. M-RETS Certificates in a Retirement Account are no longer transferable to another party and serve as an electronic proof of retirement.

Retirements are effective immediately upon completion of the transaction. Once an M-RETS Certificate is retired to a Retirement Account, M-RETS prevents the transfer of those Certificates into any other Account, including another Retirement Account (i.e., if an Organization has multiple Retirement Accounts). The Retirement Account is effectively the last resting place for an M-RETS Certificate.

### Section 4.2.6: Deposits to the Retirement Account

[*See Section 4.5.3: Certificate Retirement*](https://mrets.github.io/Operating-Procedures/blob/master/rt/section4.5.3)

### Section 4.2.7: Functionality of the Retirement Account

Retirement Accounts exist to hold Certificates permanently removed from circulation. The purpose of the Retirement Account is to demonstrate that those Certificates are subject to a voluntary or compliance claim. Once an Organization completes the retirement, they cannot later change the retirement reason. This prevents the Certificate from being subject to a double claim. If, however, the Organization contacts M-RETS in writing within 24-hours from the time the Organization indicated the reason for retirement, M-RETS may grant a variance.

M-RETS will grant a variance within the 24-hour notice period when there is no likelihood a Certificate was claimed to be retired for multiple reasons and M-RETS does not suspect any nefarious intent or impropriety. If M-RETS believes there is any chance of double-counting, they shall deny the request for a variance.

If an Organization notices an error in the selected retirement reason outside the 24-hour window, the Organization may contact M-RETS (<systemadmin@mrets.org>) in writing and ask that M-RETS grant [a variance](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Variance-Request-Form-2021.docx).[[1]](#_ftn1) M-RETS shall review all request made outside of the 24-hour window and may grant a variance if they determine that the request is made in good faith and: that the Organization submitted their request for a variance in writing within a reasonable amount of time after discovering the error, that there is a legitimate reason for the change, and that there is no likelihood a Certificate was claimed to be retired for multiple reasons. M-RETS may submit the variance request---or send an email outlining the circumstances---to a state or provincial regulator should there be concern compliance with the variance request could result in potential double-counting.

M-RETS has a pull-down menu of options for acceptable retirement reasons that the Organization must select to complete the retirement. The options will be consistent with regulatory programs and any voluntary programs or voluntary market activities. Users shall notify M-RETS if they would like to add a new type of voluntary or compliance retirement reason.

### Section 4.2.8: Functionality of the Withdrawn Account

Withdrawn Accounts exist in M-RETS to hold Certificates permanently removed from circulation. Certificate Owners may only Withdraw if after upload the Certificate Owner decided to use the Certificates in a Program that does not officially recognize M-RETS. Once an Organization completes the Withdrawal, they cannot later upload the same generation information. This prevents the Certificate from being subject to double-counting. However, if the Organization contacts M-RETS in writing within 24-hours from the time the Organization indicated the reason for Withdrawal, M-RETS may grant a variance.

M-RETS may grant a variance within the 24-hour notice period when there is no likelihood a Certificate could be subject to a claim in a system or through paper attestation or other means outside M-RETS. Moreover, M-RETS will only grant a variance if the System Administrator does not suspect any nefarious intent or impropriety. If M-RETS believes there is any chance of double-counting, they shall deny the request for a variance.

If an Organization notices an error in the Withdrawal reason outside the 24-hour window, the Organization may contact M-RETS (<systemadmin@mrets.org>) in writing and ask that M-RETS grant [a variance](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Variance-Request-Form-2021.docx).[[2]](#_ftn2) M-RETS shall review all request made outside of the 24-hour window and may grant a variance if they determine that the request is made in good faith and: that the Organization submitted their request for a variance in writing within a reasonable amount of time after discovering the error, that there is a legitimate reason for the change, and that there is no likelihood a Certificate could be claimed outside of M-RETS in a way that subjects that claim to double-counting or results in inadequate or poor data quality within M-RETS (e.g., the reason for withdrawal changes as the Certificate is intended for a different system than initially notated within M-RETS). M-RETS may submit the variance request---or send an email outlining the circumstances---to a state or provincial regulator should there be concern compliance with the variance request could result in potential double-counting or M-RETS providing inaccurate data.

M-RETS has a pull-down menu of options for acceptable Withdrawal reasons that the Generator Owner must select to complete the Withdrawal. The options will be consistent with regulatory programs and any voluntary programs or voluntary market activities. Users shall notify M-RETS if they would like to add a new Withdrawal reason.

M-RETS will work with market participants to determine Withdrawal types. For example, it could be to Export the RTC to another country or system.

### Section 4.2.9: Account Status

M-RETS classifies Accounts with the following statuses: Open, Closed, Archived, and Frozen.
