### Section 4.4.9: Changes to Issuances (Rollbacks and Prior Period Adjustments)

The User must notify M-RETS if they believe the generation data amount recorded on the Generation Log is inaccurate for any reason. This is known as registering a dispute. Adjustments made after the upload of generation data to M-RETS and/or Certificate issuance are known as Rollbacks or Prior Period Adjustments.

If the IRE or User uploaded incorrect generation data and the Certificates remain in the issuance Account, M-RETS will Rollback the issuance. Once the Rollback is complete, the Certificates may be re-uploaded.

If the IRE or User uploaded incorrect generation data and the Certificates do not remain in the issuance Account, a Prior Period Adjustment is required. M-RETS will post the Prior Period Adjustment to the Generation Log associated with the Generating Unit. This will have the effect of applying a credit or debit to the generation amount reported in the current month. Consequently, the adjustment occurs upon the next Certificate issuance. If new Certificates are created, the month of creation of the Certificates shall be the same as all other Certificates created that month. However, the Certificates will also indicate the month the prior period generation occurred.

If a User requests a Rollback outside of the acceptable upload range, M-RETS may require evidence of data inaccuracy. This includes, but is not limited to:

<ol>
  <li>Screenshot(s) of internal readings</li>
  <li>Official readouts of generation</li>
  </ol>

All requests for Rollbacks and Prior Period Adjustments are subject to review by M-RETS.
