### Section 4.3.7: Generator Inactivation

To ensure data integrity, unused or retired Generators are set to an 'Inactive' status. Only M-RETS can Inactivate a Generator. Setting a Generator to Inactive prevents any subsequent generation uploads and Certificate creation by the Generator. Inactivating a Generator does not affect previously issued Certificates.Â
