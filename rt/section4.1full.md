## Section 4.1: Users

Users may create additional Users within their Organization by accessing the Organization Information tab within the System.

M-RETS expressly prohibits the sharing of User credentials. M-RETS requires every person that logs into the System to have their own separate User login credentials. M-RETS tracks the specific activities of each User through the unique User ID and password.

More information about confidentiality can be found in the [M-RETS Terms of Use.](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MRETS-Terms-of-Use-RNG-AND-REC-Effective-January-1-2020.pdf)

### Section 4.1.1: User Permissions

<ul>
  <li>Manage: Ability to view and edit the topic</li>
  <li>Read Only: Ability to solely view the topic</li>
  <li>No Access: Inability to view or edit the topic</li>

M-RETS encourages Users to enable email notifications in their settings. An informational walk-through on notification settings is on the [integrated help system.](https://mrets.github.io/Help/billing_email_notifications)

There are three notification settings:

### Section 4.1.3: Notification Categories

#### Section 4.1.3.1: Transfers

This setting automatically emails Users upon initiation and completion of a transfer.

### Section 4.1.4: Inactivating Users

It is the Organization's responsibility to make sure the User list is current. This includes inactivating Users when they leave the company or no longer require access. This also includes adding Users to replace Users that have left the Organization. Failure to do this can lead to significant delays in accessing an Organization.

To reinstate access to M-RETS, the Organization shall be required to present specific evidence that the managing employee is no longer with the Organization and the Organization maintains no other way to reset the password (e.g., accessing the former employee's email and utilizing the password reset function). M-RETS reserves the right to set the level of specific evidence, including but not limited to affidavits from executives maintaining the circumstances surrounding the departure of the employee and failure to transfer access to another User within the Organization.

Organizations may inactivate a User at any time for any reason. M-RETS may inactivate a User for failure to adhere to the Operating Procedures or Terms of Use.
