### Section 4.3.1: Generator Registration

All Generator Owners must first establish an Organization subscription and then register the Generating Unit(s) with M-RETS. As part of the Generator Registration Agreement, the User must attest that this Unit is not registered in any other Registry. Generating Units that are jointly owned must privately appoint a single Organization where the Generator will reside.

To register the Generating Unit(s), the owner of the Generating Unit or the Responsible Party must submit to M-RETS the following:

<ol>
  <li>A completed online Generator registration form containing information related to the characteristics of the Generating Unit and associated meter.</li>
  <li>If applicable: A completed <a href="https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MRETS-Schedule-A-Modified-12-28-2017.pdf">Schedule A from the M-RETS Terms of Use outlining the Generator Owner's Designation of Responsible Party</a></li>
  <li>Any documentation requested by M-RETS to verify the registration information
    <ol>
      <li>It is helpful for generators to include a generator interconnection agreement if the generator is connected to a natural gas pipeline or a natural gas distribution network.</li>
      <li>Providing any local, state, or provincial documentation or permits that can help substantiate the generator registration data. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If this generator will use an IRE</li>
  </ol>

The Generator registration process will include both mandatory and optional data entry and M-RETS shall verify all data prior to making a Generator Active.

*NOTE: Registration with M-RETS does not imply or confer acceptance into or eligibility for any state's Renewable Portfolio Standard program.*

#### Section 4.3.1.1: Static Data in M-RETS

Static data fields describe the physical attributes of the Generating Unit. Users provide this data to M-RETS during the Generator registration process, and the subsequent update processes described below.

M-RETS shall verify all static data before including it in the System. M-RETS reserves the right to ask the generator owner for more information at any time during or after the registration phase.  In addition, M-RETS may conduct site visits to further verify the information as needed.
