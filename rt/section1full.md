# Section 1: Introduction

This document serves as a comprehensive introduction to the Midwest Renewable Energy Tracking System (M-RETS).  M-RETS staff organized this document to help lead Users through registration and use of the System.

M-RETS offers a comprehensive list of training documentation through the web application. Users can find detailed walkthroughs of features here: <https://help.mrets.org/>. M-RETS also offers custom web-based training modules for Organizations. To request training, please contact <systemadmin@mrets.org>.

M-RETS staff was all involved with the creation and editing of these Operating Procedures. At the time of creation, M-RETS staff consisted of:

Benjamin Gerber, President & Chief Executive Officer

Tanya Gajewska, Chief Administrative Officer

Rosie Hoyem, Program Manager

Sean Darling, Technical Program Coordinator

Alex Aspell, Developer

Jackie Baldwin, Software Engineering Manager

## Section 1.1: What is an RTC?
A Renewable Thermal Certificate (“RTC”) is a unique representation of the Environmental Attributes associated with the production and use of one dekatherm (“Dth”) of renewable thermal energy.  Below is a depiction of what an RTC looks like in the M-RETS RTC system.

Figures 2-4 represent the general pathway for the different currently recognized RTC pathways: Common carrier pipeline-injected RNG, Behind-the-Meter Renewable Thermal Fuel, Combined Heat and Power Using Renewable Thermal Fuels. Figure 4 would also serve to acknowledge the other methods M-RETS recognizes that utilize a more straightforward pathway such as solar thermal, geothermal, air source, ground, and water source thermal pumps, etc. If M-RETS does not list a recognized renewable thermal process, please contact the M-RETS System Administrator (systemadmin@mrets.org) to learn more and suggest an addition.
