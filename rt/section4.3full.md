## Section 4.3: Generators

M-RETS defines renewable generation as energy generated by a facility that any state, province, or territory participating in M-RETS considers renewable by law or policy. M-RETS issues one electronic Certificate for each dekatherm ("Dth") of renewable energy[[1]](#_ftn1) produced by Generators registered and approved in M-RETS. [[2]](#_ftn2) To ensure that double-counting does not occur, Generators participating in M-RETS must report 100% of their generation output in M-RETS. M-RETS maintains this requirement even if the Generator sells the remaining volumes into a regulatory program (e.g., a state Low Carbon Fuel Standard ("LCFS") or the [EPA Renewable Fuel Standard](https://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-program) ("RFS") that may not use MRETS). [[3]](#_ftn3) A Generator that sells any volume into a voluntary or regulatory program that does not utilize M-RETS in an official or unofficial capacity must use an IRE for all data reported to M-RETS. Data on generation for non-M-RETS programs will remain only visible to the Generator Owner and recognized regulatory staff.

Any Generator that produces non-electric thermal energy within North America may register in the M-RETS Renewable Thermal Registry. This includes, but is not limited to: biogas, renewable natural gas ("RNG") also known as biomethane, solar thermal, renewable gas (i.e. hydrogen produced using renewable energy),[[4]](#_ftn4) heat produced by a combined heat and power system using recognized renewable feedstock (e.g., biomass, wood waste, etc.), ground source heating and cooling pumps,[[5]](#_ftn5) and geothermal energy. Organizations may create and retire Certificates if, and only if, the end-use is for a recognized vehicle fuel program such as the LCFS or RFS and those programs publicly declare their acceptance and recognition of M-RETS as an official compliance tool.  Any other Generator may request to participate, however, that request is subject to approval by the M-RETS Board. Other states, provinces, territories, countries, or Generators outside of North America may request to use M-RETS subject to the approval of the M-RETS Board.

Any generator that delivers non-electric renewable energy into North America may register in the M-RETS Renewable Thermal Registry. Any other generator may request to participate, however, that request is subject to approval by the M-RETS Board. Other states, provinces, territories, countries, or generators outside of North America may request to use the M-RETS system subject to the approval of the M-RETS Board. In addition, M-RETS will track other generation forms (e.g., geothermal) or other Environmental Attributes.

### Section 4.3.1: Generator Registration

All Generator Owners must first establish an Organization subscription and then register the Generating Unit(s) with M-RETS. As part of the Generator Registration Agreement, the User must attest that this Unit is not registered in any other Registry. Generating Units that are jointly owned must privately appoint a single Organization where the Generator will reside.

To register the Generating Unit(s), the owner of the Generating Unit or the Responsible Party must submit to M-RETS the following:

<ol>
  <li>A completed online Generator registration form containing information related to the characteristics of the Generating Unit and associated meter.</li>
  <li>If applicable: A completed [Schedule A from the M-RETS Terms of Use outlining the Generator Owner's Designation of Responsible Party](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MRETS-Schedule-A-Modified-12-28-2017.pdf).</li>
  <li>Any documentation requested by M-RETS to verify the registration information
    <ol>
      <li>It is helpful for generators to include a generator interconnection agreement if the generator is connected to a natural gas pipeline or a natural gas distribution network.</li>
      <li>Providing any local, state, or provincial documentation or permits that can help substantiate the generator registration data. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If this generator will use an IRE</li>
  </ol>

The Generator registration process will include both mandatory and optional data entry and M-RETS shall verify all data prior to making a Generator Active.

*NOTE: Registration with M-RETS does not imply or confer acceptance into or eligibility for any state's Renewable Portfolio Standard program.*

#### Section 4.3.1.1: Static Data in M-RETS

Static data fields describe the physical attributes of the Generating Unit. Users provide this data to M-RETS during the Generator registration process, and the subsequent update processes described below.

M-RETS shall verify all static data before including it in the System. M-RETS reserves the right to ask the generator owner for more information at any time during or after the registration phase.  In addition, M-RETS may conduct site visits to further verify the information as needed.

### Section 4.3.2: Verification of Static Data Submitted During Generator Registration

Upon completion of the Generator registration process, the User represents and warrants to M-RETS that all information for this Generator shall be true, complete, and correct to the best of its knowledge, information, and belief. Any changes after submission may result in a delay in the approval process. The Generator approval process begins once the Generator is submitted from a draft status.

In the event data submitted is inaccurate or if there is a discrepancy between the information submitted during the online registration process and the materials provided to verify the information, M-RETS will notify the registrant of the issue. A process of either correcting the data in the online registration form, withdrawing the registration, or providing proof that the information on the registration form is correct will ensue between M-RETS and the registrant until M-RETS is satisfied that the information provided meets M-RETS approval standards.

M-RETS may waive the one-time generator registration fee of $1,500 if the generator commits to using an IRE for the first full year of generation information. Furthermore, the registrant must submit a signed legal attestation by the IRE that the IRE reviewed the information contained in registration and that it is true and correct to the best of the IRE's knowledge.

### Section 4.3.3: M-RETS Interaction with State Commissions and Certification of Facilities for State Programs

M-RETS shall be responsible for verifying any information submitted to M-RETS during the Generating Unit Registration Process. Each state will be responsible for determining whether a Generating Unit qualifies for a state program. The State Commissions may use the information collected and verified by M-RETS to conduct this determination.

State utility regulatory commissions have the option of asking M-RETS to send them an electronic version of the registration information for all Generating Units in their jurisdiction or claiming to be eligible for any state programs. If the state commission has exercised this option, M-RETS will send an electronic message to the designated contact at the state commission each time M-RETS registers and verifies such a Generating Unit. The state commissions reserve the right to conduct site visits or request additional information from a Generator to determine whether the facility meets all the requirements.

### Section 4.3.4: Multi-Feedstock Generator

A multi-feedstock Generator can produce energy using more than one feedstock type, where the quantity of each of the feedstock used is greater than 1% annually on a total input basis. This is often the result of Anaerobic Co-Digestion, where one or more feedstocks are added to the Anaerobic Digestion process to increase yields. [[1]](#_ftn1) A multi-feedstock Generator can be a Generating Unit that uses a renewable feedstock with a non-renewable feedstock or one that uses multiple types of renewable feedstocks. Such facilities must register with M-RETS as a multi-feedstock Generator. A Generator that uses 1% or less of a second feedstock may elect to register as a single feedstock Generator if they would like Certificates issued for the second feedstock type. If the Generator Owner or M-RETS cannot measure or calculate the relative quantities of renewable energy production from each feedstock, the generator is not eligible to register as a multi-feedstock Generating Unit in M-RETS.

M-RETS only creates Certificates for energy produced from a renewable feedstock. Each Certificate issued for a Multi-Feedstock Generating Unit will reflect only one Feedstock and Resource Type. The total number of Certificates issued for a Feedstock in a reporting period will be proportional to the output from that Feedstock for that reporting period.

The Generator or its user must maintain supporting documentation related to the derivation of the proportion of energy output per Feedstock for each Reporting Period, at the generation facility for a minimum of two years from the date of submission to M-RETS. M-RETS may require copies of such calculations and supporting documentation will be subject to audit by M-RETS, state regulators, or their agents. M-RETS shall treat as Confidential Information all data submitted to or audited by M-RETS subject to the requirements of this paragraph not contained in reports available to the public.

#### Section 4.3.4.1: Allocating Output for Each Feedstock

Upon registration, all multi-feedstock generators must submit to M-RETS a report prepared by a licensed professional engineer containing documentation for measuring and verifying the quantities of each Feedstock. M-RETS will share this documentation with state or provincial regulators upon request of the regulator.

For purposes of creating M-RETS Certificates reflecting the Feedstock mix of multi-feedstock Generating Units, the proportion of Certificates attributable to each Feedstock shall be determined consistent with reports provided by the licensed professional engineer. M-RETS reserves the right to require any Multi-Feedstock Generator to use an IRE.

### Section 4.3.5: Annual Review of Generators

M-RETS requires Users to update/review Generators once a year during the month of January to ensure correct information. M-RETS will email Users with the requisite permissions as well as prompt them within the System to complete the review.

M-RETS requires Users confirm that they represent and warrant to M-RETS that all information for their Generator shall be true, complete, and correct to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief.

M-RETS requires that Organizations review and accept all Generator data by January 31^st^. Failure to complete the annual review for each Generator in an Organization by January 31^st^ each year will result in the loss of access to the Organization until a User with proper permissions reviews and confirms all of the data for every Generator in the Organization.

### Section 4.3.6: Changes to Static Data

In addition to the annual update, Users must notify M-RETS of the following that have the effect of changing static data tracked by M-RETS within 30 calendar days of the effective date and/or knowledge of the change:

<ol>
  <li>A change in feedstock and/or Resource type at a Generating Unit, and the date on which the change occurred.</li>
  <li>A change in Generating Unit ownership (*See* Section 4.3.10: Changing the Organization to which the Generator is Associated).</li>
  <li>A change to Generator eligibility for any programs or certification tracked by M-RETS. A User may remove an eligibility at any time.</li>
  <li>A change to any of the "essential generating characteristics".</li>
  </ol>

These changes will put the affected generator into Pending Status. Before M-RETS places the Generator back into Active status, thus updating the static data, M-RETS will verify the Generator meets the changes, such as Program eligibility requirements. In the case where a state requires preapproval, M-RETS will require the appropriate documentation and reserves the right to verify this information with the appropriate state, province, or independent certification body.

M-RETS can remove Generators for cause, including willful misrepresentation of static data. M-RETS may rely on the M-RETS dispute resolution process ([See M-RETS Terms of Use](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MRETS-Terms-of-Use-RNG-AND-REC-Effective-January-1-2020.pdf)) to address such situations, and M-RETS will accept no liability for Generator misrepresentations. M-RETS reserves the right to take appropriate action in consultation with the M-RETS Board to respond to willful misrepresentation of static data, including but not limited to withholding issuing Certificates, inactivating an Organization associated with a particular Generating Unit, or withholding participation in M-RETS for Generating Units that have willfully misrepresented static data.

### Section 4.3.7: Generator Inactivation

To ensure data integrity, unused or retired Generators are set to an 'Inactive' status. Only M-RETS can Inactivate a Generator. Setting a Generator to Inactive prevents any subsequent generation uploads and Certificate creation by the Generator. Inactivating a Generator does not affect previously issued Certificates. 

### Section 4.3.8: Generator Suspension

If M-RETS has cause to suspend the Generating Utility's participation in M-RETS, Certificate production will cease until M-RETS approves a reinstatement of the Generator. Suspension of a Generator does not affect Certificates previously issued in accordance with the M-RETS Terms of Use and Operating Procedures.

### Section 4.3.9: Generator Termination

If M-RETS has cause to permanently terminate the Generating Utility's participation in M-RETS, M-RETS will cease any further production of Certificates, and the Generator will be inaccessible. Termination of a Generator does not affect Certificates previously issued in accordance with the M-RETS Terms of Use and Operating Procedures.   

If the Generator Owner wants to remove a generating unit from M-RETS, they shall notify the [M-RETS System Administrator via email](mailto:systemadmin@mrets.org) from an email account registered in that Organization with Manage Project privileges with the following information:

<ul>
  <li>The date the generating unit should be/will be removed from the M-RETS tracking system; This is the same as the final date of generation for which certificates are to be issued, and</li>
  <li>The name of the Reporting Entity, and</li>
  <li>Provide M-RETS with notice whether the Generator is moving to another tracking system and allow M-RETS to release any relevant information about the generator to the tracking System Administrator.</li>
  </ul>

M-RETS will issue Certificates for any generation that occurs prior to the date of generating unit termination as instructed by the Generator Owner. Because of the lag time between generation and Certificate issuance, this may mean that Certificates will be issued and deposited after the termination date, but only for generation that occurred prior to the termination date. Certificates will be issued for generation that occurred prior to the termination date, but whose meter reading came in within 62 days after the termination date. M-RETS will not issue Certificates for generation that occurs after the termination date.

### Section 4.3.10: Changing the Organization to which the Generator is Associated

If the Generator Owner or Responsible Party ("Transferor") wants to change the Organization to which a Generating Unit is associated, they can do so by requesting the change from M-RETS in writing or via email.

The Transferor must confirm the following:

<ol>
  <li>The Organization Name and Organization I.D. of the Transferor.</li>
  <li>The Generator Name and M-RETS I.D.</li>
  <li>The effective date of the change and the last vintage that should be issued to the Transferor.</li>
  </ol>

The Transferee must confirm the following:

<ol>
  <li>The Organization Name and Organization I.D.</li>
  <li>The Generator Name and M-RETS I.D.</li>
  <li>The Account Name and Account I.D. to which the Generator will initially issue Certificates upon competition of the change.</li>
  <li>The effective date of the change and the first vintage that should be issued to the Transferee.</li>
  <li>Any changes to the static Generator data (e.g., new Reporting Entity, Eligibilities).</li>
  </ol>

Certificates from generation that occurred up to the day the Organization change takes effect will be issued into the Organization that the Generating Unit was associated with at the time the generation occurred.

*For example, if the Generator owner changes the Organization to which a given Generating Unit is associated from Organization A to Organization B, and the change is effective on March 1, then the Certificates from generation uploaded prior to March 1 will be deposited into Organization A.*

There cannot be any lapse in time where the Generator is not associated with an M-RETS Organization. If there is a period when the Generator is not associated with an M-RETS Organization, M-RETS will treat this as an Inactivation/Reactivation of the Generator instead of a change of Organization.

Any fractional remainder dekatherms will transfer to the new owner of the Generator.

### Section 4.3.11: Assignment of Rights of Registration -- Designation of Responsible Party

The owner of a Generating Unit or Responsible Party may assign the right to register the Generating Unit(s) in M-RETS to an M-RETS Organization for the purposes of allowing that party the ability to control and manage the disposition of any M-RETS Certificates resulting from the operation of the Generating Unit(s). This assignment of registration rights will give the designated Organization full and sole management and authority over the transactions and activities related to the Generating Unit within M-RETS. For the purposes of M-RETS, this party is the Responsible Party for that Generating Unit.

M-RETS will require both parties to confirm an assignment of registration rights and the date the assignment will be effective, and the termination date if applicable.

### Section 4.3.12: Termination of Rights of Registration

The Generator Owner or the Responsible Party may terminate the Rights of Registration subject to confirmation by M-RETS that both the Generator Owner and Responsible Party agree to the termination. The User will file the Generating Unit Termination form with M-RETS. The form specifies who the new Responsible Party with the Rights of Registration is and the date the change in registration will occur. Termination of Rights of Registration has the effect of deregistering the Generating Unit from M-RETS. Thus, no new Certificates will be issued from that generating upon the effective date of the termination. *See* Section 4.3.10: Changing the Organization to which the Generator is Associated for additional information.

### Section 4.3.13: Changing Rights of Registration

When changing the Rights of Registration, the disposition of the Certificates from that Generating Unit will follow the rules in Section 4.3.11: Assignment of Rights of Registration -- Designation of Responsible Party. This function applies equally to the Generator Owner or a Responsible Party, meaning that the Responsible Party can change the Rights of Registration to another party.

When changing the Rights of Registration, M-RETS will confirm that both parties (the Generator Owner or current Responsible Party and the new Responsible Party) agree to the change. If the Generator Owner or Responsible Party wants to change the Organization to which a Generating Unit is associated, they can do so by filing the Generating Unit Transfer Form with M-RETS. The form specifies who the new Responsible Party with the Rights of Registration is, and the date the change in registration will occur. There cannot be any lapse in time where the Generating Unit is not associated with an M-RETS Organization. If there is a period when the Generating Unit is not associated with an M-RETS Organization, M-RETS will treat this as a deregistration/re-registration of the Generating Unit. A Unit that is deregistered and re-registered may have the Generating Unit Registration Fee waived unless there are significant modifications to the Generating Unit data.

The User must also review---and update if necessary---the basic Generator Registration data when the Right of Registration is changed from one party to another.
