### Section 4.6.5: Export of Certificates

M-RETS can only export Certificates to a Compatible Certificate Tracking System. For Certificates that are exported, the cooperative agreements between the tracking systems handle how to prevent double counting.

To export Certificates from M-RETS to a Compatible Tracking System, the M-RETS User must select the batch of Certificates to export from an active Account and initiate a transfer using the Export Transfer option. The User must identify the following information:

1. Compatible Certificate Tracking System
2. The name of the intended recipient of the exported RECs
3. System ID of the party receiving the transfer (if available)

After initiation, the designated Certificate is placed in a &quot;pending&quot; status to ensure that the Certificates cannot be inadvertently transferred or sold. M-RETS will communicate with the Administrator of the Compatible Certificate Tracking System and arrange for the transfer of Certificates. If the Compatible Certificate Tracking System accepts the transfer, the Certificates will be removed from the M-RETS User&#39;s active Account. The status of the Certificates will be changed from &quot;export pending&quot; to &quot;exported.&quot;
