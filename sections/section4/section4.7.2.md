### Section 4.7.2: Participating in a Program

Once an Organization accepts an invitation to participate in a Program, the accepting Organization must create a new Retirement Account and link the Account to the Program. As Certificates are retired into this Account, they will automatically appear on both the Program Administrator and the participant&#39;s Program dashboard. This dashboard is tailored to only show relevant information for their Program.

If a User attempts to retire Certificates that do not match the predetermined criteria of the Program, the System blocks the retirement. This prevents the retirement of incorrect Certificates.

A walk through guide to participating in a Program may be found[here](https://help.mrets.org/within-the-system/programs/participating-in-a-program).
