## Section 5.3: RRC Adjusted Quantity

Wisconsin Stat. ยง 196.378(2)(b)1m.a. states that hydroelectric facilities owned or operated by Wisconsin electric providers during the &quot;baseline&quot; 2001-2003 period receive average value for purposes of the Wisconsin RPS. This value is based on an annual average production during the three-year baseline period. This in effect creates two different values: &quot;Quantity&quot; and &quot;RRC Adjusted Quantity&quot;

 M-RETS automatically calculates the RRC Adjusted Quantity for use in the Wisconsin RPS Program once all Generators subject to this rule have all data uploaded for the compliance year. When using the M-RETS Program function, the correct number for compliance is the RRC Adjusted Quantity. For Generators participating in the Wisconsin RPS that do not have a three-year hydro average the RRC Adjusted Quantity and the Quantity should be equal.
