Section 5: Wisconsin RPS
========================

Certificates that are eligible for the Wisconsin RPS Program have one of
the following eligibilities: WI Bankable and WI Non-Bankable. More
information on the Wisconsin RPS can be found
[here](https://psc.wi.gov/Pages/Programs/RpsCompliance.aspx).

Section 5.1: WI Bankable
------------------------

M-RETS classifies Certificates that are WI RRC eligible and less than
four years old as WI Bankable. WI Bankable Certificates are valid for
Wisconsin compliance up to four years after the vintage year listed on
the Certificate. After the fourth year, M-RETS removes the WI Bankable
Certificate eligibility and the Certificate no longer qualifies for the
Wisconsin RPS.

Section 5.2: WI Non-Bankable
----------------------------

M-RETS classifies Certificates that are not WI RRC eligible and less
than one year old as WI Non-Bankable. Organizations may only retire
Certificates for the Wisconsin RPS that are Non-Bankable for the
compliance year matching the vintage listed on the Certificate. For
example, a Wisconsin compliance Organization may retire a 2017 WI
Non-Bankable Certificate for the 2017 Wisconsin RPS but not for the 2018
Wisconsin RPS. Because M-RETS does not set expiration dates on RECs, a
User may still use a 2017 Wisconsin Non-Bankable REC for other purposes
if that REC meets the guidelines for other state or voluntary programs.
After the closure of the Wisconsin RPS program each year, M-RETS will
remove the WI Non-Bankable designation from Certificates that are not in
an M-RETS Retirement Account but no longer qualify according to
Wisconsin state law and regulations.

Section 5.3: RRC Adjusted Quantity
----------------------------------

Wisconsin Stat. ยง 196.378(2)(b)1m.a. states that hydroelectric
facilities owned or operated by Wisconsin electric providers during the
"baseline" 2001-2003 period receive average value for purposes of the
Wisconsin RPS. This value is based on an annual average production
during the three-year baseline period. This in effect creates two
different values: "Quantity" and "RRC Adjusted Quantity"

M-RETS automatically calculates the RRC Adjusted Quantity for use in the
Wisconsin RPS Program once all Generators subject to this rule have all
data uploaded for the compliance year. When using the M-RETS Program
function, the correct number for compliance is the RRC Adjusted
Quantity. For Generators participating in the Wisconsin RPS that do not
have a three-year hydro average the RRC Adjusted Quantity and the
Quantity should be equal.
