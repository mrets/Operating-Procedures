### Section 4.4.3: Requirements of Data Reporting Entities (QREs)

M-RETS will accept generation data from Control Area Operators, Qualified Reporting Entities and Self-Reporting Generators.

M-RETS maintains an agreement with each of these reporting entities, known as the Reporting Entity Terms of Use, that describes the terms and conditions under which the reporting entity agrees to exchange information and conduct business with M-RETS. M-RETS will maintain a list in each QRE&#39;s Organization of the Generating Units for which the QRE is reporting. M-RETS will outline the protocols for collection of information such as meter IDs, data format, communication protocols and timing, and security requirements for data collection in the Interface Control Document. M-RETS will update this document when any changes are made that may impact the data collection process. To minimize the impact of document changes, this document is a general template that outlines a common approach and set of standards. The Reporting Entity Terms of Use contain the specific data collection parameters for each reporting entity. M-RETS will work with the personnel from the QREs to verify information and address specific requirements of each reporting entity.

M-RETS reserves the right to audit the MWh data totals submitted at any time.
