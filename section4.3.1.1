#### Section 4.3.1.1: Static Data in M-RETS

Static data fields describe the physical attributes of the Generating Unit. Users provide this data to M-RETS during the Generator registration process, and the subsequent update processes described below.

M-RETS shall verify all static data before including it in the System. Appendix A: Generator Static Data Fields lists the method of verification for each data field. In addition, M-RETS may conduct site visits to further verify the information as needed.
