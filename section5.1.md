## Section 5.1: WI Bankable

M-RETS classifies Certificates that are WI RRC eligible and less than four years old as WI Bankable. WI Bankable Certificates are valid for Wisconsin compliance up to four years after the vintage year listed on the Certificate. After the fourth year, M-RETS removes the WI Bankable Certificate eligibility and the Certificate no longer qualifies for the Wisconsin RPS.
