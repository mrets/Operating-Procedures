### Section 4.4.2: Uploading Time Restrictions

To encourage timely reporting, M-RETS enabled automatic validations to generation uploads. For small Generators (1 to 150 kW nameplate capacity), Users have up to one year from the generation end date to upload generation. For large Generators (\&gt;150 kW nameplate capacity), Users have 62-days from the generation end date to upload generation. M-RETS must approve any generation outside of these ranges. Failure to adhere to these ranges may lead to delays in receiving Certificates.
